I had problems with the first Spider-man movie too, I found the Green Goblin to be very annoying for instance, but the origin story in Spiderman 1 with Toby Maguire was perfection! Sam Raimi's addition of biological based web spinners was an inspiration to the to the Spidey canon, so WHY go backwards and give the web-slinger mechanically based webs? How could a high school kid like Peter Parker afford super high tech web spinners, not to mention the refills! Why change the origin story from a nuclear irradiated spider that bites Peter Parker to a regular spider that may or may not have been genetically altered? Why make Peter Parker a jerk who, as soon as he acquires his powers becomes a bully who now bullies his former bully Flash, and then steals Flash's girlfriend. Don't worry, for some inexplicable reason, Flash forgives by the end of the movie.. Andrew Garfield isn't awful, Sally Field and Martin Sheen, all try their best with a terrible script. For instance, when Peter comes home late after being bitten by the spider, he's sweaty, sick looking and literally raids the fridge while his seemingly unconcerned Uncle Ben and Aunt May make jokes about her awful meatloaf... HELLO? Your nephew Peter looks like he's on DRUGS and you two are too oblivious to see it? The problem is the illogical script, but it's also bad direction, not to mention continuity errors. I'm not going to pile on, I didn't hate this movie, I just didn't like it... Go rent Spiderman 2, which is my all-time favorite Spider-man movie to date.\",\n",

I have viewed a few one star movies such as Die Darkman Die and I find it hard to believe that DKR would rate a one star from anyone. Considering each movie in The Dark Knight Trilogy on its own merit I would  give a Three and a half for Batman Begins, a solid Four and a half for The Dark Knight due inpart for the strong acting perfomance by Heath Ledger as The Joker. The Dark Knight Rises concluded the the trilogy with what I believe to be the best of the three due to its storytelling. After The Dark Knight movie I thought  how can the next movie top this one. I'm not sure yet whether it did or not but it was a solid and fast moving story that did not seem to be two hours and forty five minutes in length. The movie was engaging and held my attention through out. As for the Avengers movie it dragged along as Marvel created a scenario for each of the Avengers.

Unfortunately, Happy can't be trusted.Director Mitch Glazer's Passion Play is the most bizarre combination of science fiction fantasy and noir I've ever seen.  There are scenes that generate such great tension that my breath was literally taken away.  Megan Fox is simply incredible as the innocent, nave, attractive Lily who craves to look like other girls.  My heart broke for her, knowing that she was being duped by the despicable Nate Pool.  He's a coarse, slimy loser that I never much liked.  However, towards the end, Nate does experience a change in heart which causes the viewer to root for him as he eludes Happy's thugs.Passion Play does contain some bloody surprises and shocks, which make it a good noir.  The desert scenes were beautiful in their bare, breathtaking majesty - the land from which Lily is taken.  She is transported to the gritty, dirty big city where the bloody love triangle of this bizarre passion play begins to reveal itself.  Poor, lonely Lily finds herself at the center of at least three men who all want to exploit her for her unusual body.  (Many women find themselves in the same situation as Lily.  They just want to be loved for themselves.)  In her desperation to be accepted as normal, Lily seeks medical advice in having her wings removed.  Little does she know that this unusual gift will eventually bring her freedom.While watching Passion Play, I was reminded of best-selling author James Patterson's When the Wind Blows and its equally superb sequel The Lake House.  Both novels involve the exploitation of children who have been genetically engineered to have bird-like wings.  They can actually fly.  Lily was born with wings.  Sam, the owner of the sideshow, found her in the garbage when she was a baby.  Unfortunately, he would never allow her to leave the nest.  In Patterson's novels, a veterinarian, Frannie O'Neill, and an FBI agent, Kit Brennan, help the children escape evil scientists and their laboratories.If one is tired of the same old bloody, shoot-`em-up crime drama, then I recommend viewing Passion Play, which has a lot of heart.  The film's hero, Nate Pool, finds himself in the biggest moral dilemma of his life; he risks death for a woman with whom he had no intention of falling in love.  Unfortunately, Image Entertainment's DVD release is lacking in special features.  (At least my copy was.)  The film is presented in its theatrical release aspect ratio of 2.40:1 and has SDH and Spanish subtitles.  However, it doesn't have any special features such as audio commentaries, deleted/extended scenes, bloopers, making of documentaries, cast/crew interviews, etc.On the DVD, there is a trailer for Passion Play as well as trailers for three other Image Entertainment films of various genres:  The first is for Burning Palms, the bizarre anthology of five sexually-explicit stories that are both shocking and horrifying; the second is for Wild Cherry, a raunchy teen flick in which a group of girls get revenge on the guys who've sexually exploited them; and the third is for The Violent Kind, a grisly horror film where three male friends go to a party in the boonies and are viciously attacked and tortured by insane country bumpkins.  Of the three, Burning Palms is probably the most original.Joseph B. Hoyos\",\n",

(see my review.)I am not usually a big fan of combination pianist/conductor set-ups, but in this repertoire, I much prefer this version to the Barenboim set, good as it is.Buchbinder plays with a much lighter touch than Barenboim, and seems more whimsical.The tempi are considerably quicker. Plus you don't have to watch Barenboim mopping up his perspiration every few bars!  I really enjoyed #'s 1 & 3 here more than I usually do, due to his playing sensibilities. I've always been fond of #'s 2 & 5, but I still don't love #4. Buchbinder plays and conducts without a score, a sign of his knowing these concerti inside out. (I'm always skeptical of pianists that need a score in performance.) There just seems to be so much joy in his playing, and this infectiousness is evident in the orchestra members as well.What can you say about the Vienna Phil. and Beethoven? They are inseparable, Every bar is in their blood.You will hear details in the score you have not previously heard - some of this due to a slightly scaled-down orchestra (only four basses). The sound quality in DTS-MASTER AUDIO is immaculate, both for piano and orchestra.The video is outstanding also - using unusual camera angles from behind and above the orchestra to show the pianist's keyboard technique.There is a short interview with Buchbinder and Dr.Joachim Kaiser that delves into the differences in the original and newer editions of the scores - showing mistakes that were made in the copying and hence performance errors - fascinating stuff!I bought this disc from Amazon UK (available earlier and cheaper than Amazon USA) If you buy discs from them, they show them at 17.99 pounds, but when you check out it reduces to 14.99. Even with a cost of $5 shipping, with the current exchange rate, this means you get a bluray for $29 delivered. If you buy multiples, your shipping cost is much reduced.

              "       \"DIRTY MARY, CRAZY LARRY basically plays like the actors were strapped into a car going like a bat and just ad-libbed the entire movie as they went. Famous show-stopper ending gives this a twist that helped make the film memorable. Performances are loose, at best, and truly nothing to rave about. The short Making Of featurette basically confirms that much of the film's dialogue was, in fact, improvised by the actors, with only general plot ideas to guide them. Easily the least of these two films, IMHO.RACE WITH THE DEVIL starts out well enough and then quickly turns into a homicidal, paranoia-fueled, nightmare ride! It's one of those films where you find yourself yelling at the characters to NOT do this or DO that because, unlike them, you've seen this kind of situation before in other films and know they're headed for trouble but you want to see them make it through safely. Surprisingly, this movie actually gets better as it rolls along. The stunt work is ambitious, amazingly intense and very well-done for a low budget drive-in film. Good performances all around in this one. The ending was the only really &#34;bad&#34; part of the movie, for me. Still, even with the downer (yet somehow still sort of vaguely open-ended) finale, I enjoyed this film. It was an engrossing road trip from, to, and thru Hell.This Blu-ray is well-presented and a really good bargain. The print transfers look quite good for both movies and the video & audio are strong & solid, with crisp colors, sharp focus and clear sound. Extras include trailers for both, plus each film has a newly-shot Making Of mini feature going into detail about the films. A nice touch that sadly isn't done enough on older, obscure films like these. I liked them both. 3 stars for DIRTY MARY, CRAZY LARRY and 5 stars for RACE WITH THE DEVIL... so I split the difference and gave this double feature Blu-ray 4 stars.\",\n",
              "       \"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is a rollicking piece of eye candy directed with aplomb by live-action novice Brad Bird, yet it is not without its flaws. Many of the action sequences--including the amazingly inventive and enthralling centerpiece--a risky `secure the macguffin' scene in and around the world's tallest building--absolutely stun. The characters, notably the ever-cheeky Simon Pegg and relative newcomer Jeremy Renner, are highly likable (even Tom Cruise delivers an understated and magnetic performance, despite looking about half-a-year too old for the role). The film is slightly overlong and the plot paper-thin however, which shouldn't be a problem for the adolescent target audience. More or less the objective (should you choose to accept it) is to secure the case. What's in the case? Nuke codes! Why does the villain want them? World domination! Why? Who cares! Can we stop him? Well, we'll sure give it the ol' college try. Boom. Blam. Globe-trotting, fisticuffs, and dandy gadgetry-fueled action sequences ensue. The film is goofy (see the clumsily-animated CGI opening titles), charming (gotta love that theme song, even the tenth time!), and watchable, yet a little too ridiculous from time to time (why does Ethan feel the need to send that car crashing down at the end? Just for the sake of one more explosion?) and overlong by about fifteen minutes. Still, if you are looking for mindless popcorn entertainment, you could do a lot worse. Yes, Michael Bay, I'm looking at you. You could learn a lot from Mr. Bird, who, given a little less puffy of a script, could create great things. And perhaps, next year, he will.\",\n",

The contest itself is quite good as the momentum shifted constantly, each guy got some good near falls in and Dolph did prove he could hang with a main eventer, kinda reminded me of Edge/Shawn Michaels at Royal Rumble '05 where the veteran Shawn helped establish Edge. The crowd did seem divded as there were some chants for Ziggler, then near the end with Vickie, the ref and Dolph down, Edge hits the spear, plays possum hits the Killswitch and covers Dolph to win. 9/10.-WWE Championship Match, The Miz (Champion) w/Alex Riley vs. Randy Orton: At TLC Miz escaped with the title in a Table's Match, but there would be no running as Orton was looking to take the championship from the Miz in this rematch. Randy worked over Miz for a few then Miz took over, with Riley getting some cheap shots in when the ref wasn't looking, Miz does have a good showing here hanging with the Viper and wearing him down. There's the expected Orton comeback, Randy goes for the RKO but the Nexus comes down to the ring and Orton sends Riley over the top onto them. There's the RKO to Miz, CM Punk sneaks in and hits the GTS and Miz covers to win the match. 6/10, cause of the interference.-Fatal Four Way Match for the Diva's Championship Match, Natalya (Champion) vs. Michelle McCool vs. Layla vs. Eve: This was originally supposed to be a 2 on 1 Handicap Match, but the Anonymous Raw GM chimes in and adds Eve to the mix. Its not a great match as the crowd didn't really seem to care, especially when Eve was announced as the fourth entrant. It is however passable and thankfully short as we see Eve hit the moonsault on Layla and covers her to win the title. 4/10, with the crowd again not really reacting too much, though Eve did seem happy to win, even crying as she walked up the ramp.-The Royal Rumble Match: Not the usual 30 but 40 men in the match this year,  there's a brawl that occurs between the new Nexus and the Corre that sets the tone for the night. CM Punk is #1, Daniel Bryan is #2 and this is a ROH fans dream as these two had great matches against each other before coming to WWE. Its a pretty good but drawn out Rumble, Regal gets a nice pop at #5, John Morrison at #7 does a spiderman like move that has to be seen to be believed, once the rest of the new Nexus comes out and dominates for a few minutes it looks like Punk will waltz to Wrestlemania. The return of Booker T gets a massive reaction from the crowd and Striker but he's gone in about a minute, of course John Cena comes out and clears the ring of Nexus and Punk.Sadly Hornswoggle is in this too and this is where the Rumble gets dumb, as he and Cena team up which as much as I don't like Cena this makes him look bad. It picks back up when people like Sheamus and Wade Barrett enter the fray and the surprise return of Diesel at #32 gets easily the biggest reaction of the night from the crowd and again from Striker himself. However Diesel doesn't last too long but has a face off with Big Show and yet another reaction from Striker. Soon after Alex Riley ends up screwing up and getting eliminated too soon so an audible is called with Miz coming in and throwing Cena over the top to the floor.The rest of the Rumble is good with Santino entering and getting knocked out of the ring but not over the top, Alberto Del Rio is #38 and has a decent showing, Kane at #40 shockingly doesn't last too long as he's eliminated. The finish is a bit odd as Del Rio appears to have won but Santino comes back in, hits the Cobra Strike but ends up getting tossed over the top so Del Rio is going to Wrestlemania. 9/10 as it wasn't maybe the greatest Rumble ever but it was a lot of fun with surprise returns and some great moments.Extras-Todd Grisham Interviews Eve after her title win: Standard interview where Eve was very happy to have won the title.-1/31/11, Raw, Alberto Del Rio's Royal Rumble Celebration: Funny stuff with Del Rio saying he told everyone it was his destiny to win and go onto Wrestlemania, good heel promo from Del Rio too.Blu-Ray Exclusive Extra-1/24/11, The Entire Monday Night Raw Before the Royal Rumble: Great extra here as we see the final set up for the PPV with some good matches, well worth watching.\",\n",

              "       \"When Wes Craven's SCREAM came along, it was a breath of fresh air in the otherwise-stale genre: it pointed out all of horror's flaws, while highlighting its attributes.  It managed to give a few genuine scares while being absolutely hilarious.  Part of this was the result of Craven's vast experience scaring the crap out of people; part was due to screenwriter Kevin Williamson's over-dramatization of teen angst (Smells Like Teen Intestine anyone?); and part was due to Neve Campbell's innate relatability, Courtney Cox's ability to channel her inner b****, and David Arquette's goofy likability.For the fourth film, these three characteristics return, albeit in minor form.  Williamson sounds more like Aaron Sorkin in spots, spouting off pop-culture dialogue that, fortunately, hits more than it misses.  Campbell is a minor player, though a strong one; Arquette and Cox are equally reduced to the sidelines, and while Cox has an intense scene, Arquette is left bumbling around (but not as amusingly as in the first film).  As for the new cast, only Hayden Panettierie and Rory Culkin really stand out; Emma Roberts is supposedly the new lead, and her performance gets decidedly stronger near the film's end, but for the first three-fourths she has little to do except scream and look pretty, much like the rest of the cast.  Craven himself seems more intent on dissecting his previous three films than scaring us.  There are only two genuinely strong scenes: one in which Ghostface curiously watches as one of his victims dies on his blade; and another later in the film, where a killer constructs the perfect crime scene.  These scenes don't carry quite the impact of, say, the rape scene in THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, but they are certainly interesting horror movie moments.SCREAM 4 is the strongest of the sequels (not that that's saying much).  It's nowhere near as good as the first, nor does it try to be.  Which, maybe, it should.  The film is way too weak to stand on its own; as a sequel, it shines, but as a horror film, it's utterly meaningless.  In fact, it comes very close to falling victim to the point it's trying to make: there are few original horror ideas in Hollywood today.  Still, there's something to be said for constructing a successful self-referential horror film, and no one does it quite like the Williamson/Craven film; it's laugh-out-loud funny in spots, jump-in-your-seat startling in others.  It's not scary, and it won't make you rethink anything the way the first did.  But if you just take it for what it is--a solid sequel--then it's worth a viewing or two.\",\n",

              "       \"There is absolutely nothing of redeeming social value in this raunchy 2011 fantasy comedy, but there are some absurdly funny bits here and there to make it mildly infectious at times. Directed by David Gordon Green, who started in indie films (the acclaimed George Washington) but last helmed the stoner farcePineapple Express, the film relies heavily on scatological banter, lowbrow sight gags, and over-the-top CGI effects to punctuate the sophomoric screenplay by star Danny McBride and Ben Best. McBride stars as Prince Thadeous, the cowardly brother of the heroic Prince Fabious, who is about to marry the wide-eyed virgin Belladonna when lo and behold, the villainous wizard Leezar kidnaps her and traps her in a tower like Rapunzel.Of course, that's the cue for Fabious to take Thadeous and his manservant Courtney to search for her with the aid of a band of knights who soon betray him. Although this is a medieval story with the appropriate sets and costumes, not much of the script is played to period. For the most part, the movie feels like a tribute to the likes of Mel Brooks, Cheech & Chong, andMonty Python and the Holy Grail, with the garrulous McBride conveying his character's oversized bravado with tongue firmly in cheek. Meanwhile, James Franco plays Fabious with his slightly askew, surfer-dude manner intact, while Zooey Deschanel plays Belladonna with only a modicum of her usually ironic delivery. As Leezar, Justin Theroux has a field day with the wizard's grandiose manner and lascivious intensity.Rasmus Hardiker manages to give dimension to the seemingly enfeebled Courtney who inexplicably remains devoted to Thadeous despite the constant humiliation he experiences. Midway through the film enters Natalie Portman as Isabel, a merciless, Xena-like warrior who doesn't suffer fools gladly. Playing the polar opposite of her Oscar-winning role inBlack Swan, she is convincing in her predictably cardboard role as a fiery avenger, whether thwacking the heads of a hydra in a Thunderdome-type arena or beating Thadeous up without breaking a sweat. Even with all the high-octane scares and thrills, the creators never forget to surrender to their more puerile instincts like the minotaur's legacy around Thadeous's neck. And yes, I laughed every time I saw it.\",\n",

              "       \"Capriccio represents the culmination of Strauss's operatic career, just as Metamorphosen and the Four Last Songs are the capstones of his orchestral and vocal writing.  Capriccio was premiered in 1942 in Munich, whose beloved opera house was destroyed by Allied bombing the following year.  The Nazi regime, too, soon fell, but Strauss's opera--focusing on eternal questions of love and art--has become increasingly popular and is widely considered one of his greatest works.In the notes for this recording, George Hall writes, Despite the extreme circumstances surrounding its creation--catastrophic for the wider world, imbued with fear and shame for Strauss himself, whose chief concern during these years was to protect his beloved Jewish daughter-in-law and grandsons--Capriccio is far more than the piece of elegant escapism Strauss's detractors have claimed it to be.  In Capriccio, he continues, Strauss reasserted his commitment to the values of art as a civilised and civilising pursuit at one of the periods when those values were most under threat.This production from the Metropolitan Opera could not be bettered.  Although the time is moved from the 18th to the early 20th century, the change of eras is hardly noticeable.  The setting (the interior of the Countess's chateau) and costumes are beautifully detailed and realistic.  Andrew Davis leads the musical forces in a superlative performance--from the ravishing opening sextet to the Countess's great closing monologue.  All of the singers are excellent, but Renee Fleming is the unquestioned star, who is on stage almost throughout and holds the opera together.  As Times reviewer Anthony Tommasini says, Fleming grab[s] every chance to let her voice bloom.  In the final monologue her voice is plush and alluring, her phrasing noble.At the end of Capriccio, the questions the opera poses remain unresolved.  Words or music?  Poet or composer?  That is as it should be.\",\n",

Too many people are filled with some of the very characteristics the film portrays as what's wrong with the world; greed, materialism, competitiveness and hate.  I believe we are presently at our zenith, if you can call it that, as a species and will be on the decline from here on.  The very skills and abilities that got us to this point as humans will be the source of our undoing and the raison d'tre of our decline and perhaps, extinction.  The Earth will go on very well without us, save for a super size asteroid, perhaps changed but it will reclaim itself and heal the damage we've done.I found the film both inspiring and depressing.  Inspiring in what could be and that there is some greatness and good in the world, but depressing in that there is much more evil, excess and greed.  The way events are progressing, our destiny is probably fated to end badly.  If you agree with the film's premise, you might say the human species will be part of a grand experiment that failed.  Or, you may conclude it is all part of evolution, particularly of the human race and in the end was destined to be unsuccessful.I give the film 5 stars for its goal in educating the people who watch it and its efforts to somehow turn things around.  Compare and contrast the commentators in this film with our country's politicians (U.S.), corporate CEO's, the world's leaders and maybe some of your own acquaintances, all of whom collectively, have the power to change the world's direction.  What a dismal thought this comparison is for most of us.As you can see, I am not optimistic about the human race and its future.  Those who are the haves, rather than the have-nots, will probably look on the film's makers, commentators and those who agree with its message as no more than a bunch of bleeding hearts.  I think the film's detractors are wrong and guided by their own avarice, materialism and lack of compassion for others.  Their hearts are closed and their minds blinded.  Funny thing is, the film did demonstrate most convincingly that the heart, rather than the brain, is the seat of our feelings and empathy.If you look at history with complete honesty and objectivity, then you must conclude that now, overall, most of its populace are in the worst of times.  Are we inherently good, or bad?  We're all on the Titanic with a few in First Class, some in Second, and too many in Third Class.  This time there are no lifeboats at all, so ironically, everyone will go down with the ship if and when disaster hits.

First-time director, Francesco Barilli (a former painter), has an eye for detail and infuses &#34;Perfume&#34; with scenes of languid glamour and creeping menace; his visual style is well-served by this lovely Raro Video restoration (which accounts for one of the two stars I awarded to this film).Actress Mimsy Farmer plays Sylvia, an alleged chemist who spends most of the film calling in sick to work.  Sylvia has violent secrets in her past that seem to be resurfacing in dreams and hallucinations.  Concurrently, literally everyone who Sylvia comes into contact with--friends, neighbors, lover, co-workers, the local taxidermist--seems to be harboring some shady secret of their own as they slink around the colorful sets, whispering together, nodding knowingly as they head for midnight assignations in some crumbling ruin.  Soon enough, Syvia is on the verge of full-fledged psychosis.  Or is she?  Do the wealthy voodoo experts know something they're not telling, or are they, too, part of Sylvia's madness.  By the time the movie arrives at its unlikely and gruesome finale, I'd stopped caring.  More a horror story than a giallo, &#34;Perfume&#34; ends on an incoherent note that offers no satisfaction; in fact, many viewers will either probably find themselves laughing (though not in a good way) at the filmmaker's audacity, or angrily simmering to see their patience so deliriously and contemptuously disregarded.As an actress, Farmer often played vulnerable, neurotic beauties whose classy fragility belied a hidden physicality that unexpectedly surfaced in scenes of surprising carnality and violence.  Blonde and ethereal, Farmer carries the film (as much as she can) with a convincing aura of tortured intellect, sadness and impending doom.  The film gets another star for her performance.  Unfortunately, her co-stars don't help her out much.  Mario Scaccia, as an eccentric, initially helpful neighbor, looks more like a mad scientist than Farmer, who is, literally, the mad scientist of the story, and Mauricio Bonuglia, as Farmer's lover, seems to struggle with a character that is poorly conceived.  The ghostly little girl played by Daniela Barnes, is also ill-conceived, given the direction that the movie takes.  The rest of the cast, although they appear and re-appear, like phantoms, throughout the film, are more memorable as a whole, than for any single character anyone plays.Visually, &#34;The Perfume of the Lady in Black&#34; is a strikingly stylish example of a particular period in Italian filmmaking.

Writer Sam Wexler is on his way to an interview with a publisher about his new novel when he notices a boy being left behind by his family on the subway.  Torn between getting to his interview on time and his sense of inherent responsibility, he takes the boy along with him to the interview.  He blows the interview and now turns his attention to getting the boy, Rasheen, back to his family.  What ensues is both heart-breaking and comical.  Every attempt to turn Rasheen over to the authorities ends badly.  Rasheen is then incorporated into Sam's rather unorthodox life populated by friends who're trying their best to make their lives meaningful.

It is the way of handing people their pink slip. It's an assembly line that is efficient  and cold. It is a human slaughterhouse in action.That is how this film starts, a man is being laid off after so many years. The Human Resources executive doesn't have a sympathetic ear, a kind word, or even a warm smile.  When the victim (played by Stanley Tucci), tells her that there is some important project he was completing, she dismisses his concern. His message could be that she is on a sinking ship and she doesn't know the gravity of her own situation. In fact, that is what he was indirectly trying to tell her. He could only tell it to a now former colleague to whom he passes a jump drive, just before the elevator door closes on him and his career.By early evening the colleague installs the drive and looks at his work.  The numbers don't lie. The company is on the verge of imminent financial disaster. He makes a call summoning people back to work which eventually reaches up the entire chain of command to the C.E.O. It is now late at night, and decisions have to be made, decisions that will bankrupt the firm or sucker other investors to ensure the company's survival.A number of characters come into play here, the one who is fired, the ones who will be fired, the one who will be blamed, the one who will make the decision, and the one who will abide by it because--he needs the money.This suspenseful film takes place over the course of one day, from morning to morning. What makes it work besides a fine cast is that you are pretty certain you know the outcome, but you, and forgive me for saying so, don't want to buy the outcome.You can hedge your bet that you will be entertained, but perhaps not in a pleasing way. This film is a dose of reality in the way business is conducted. It is ruthless, heartless and is only interested in Profit Resources, not Human Resources. It shows that these people can be robbers, eager to pull the trigger on loyal employees or investors who trusted them. The firm may give knowledgeable people a chilling reminder of Goldman Sachs, and how they treated their investors.Zachary Quinto, Kevin Spacey, Paul Bethany, Demi Moore, and Jeremy Irons are the cast that makes the financial meltdown of 2008 a taut thriller under the direction of J. C. Chandler. During that night, while the rest of us slept or went about our business of an honest day's labor, many others were burning the midnight oil in bringing on the worst financial disaster in 70 years.Margin Call is your call, but if I were you I wouldn't miss it, especially if you already trust your money in someone else's hands.\",\n",

That's partially due to a crushing lack of Tommy Lee Jones, who's relegated to a mere cameo appearance, but more thoroughly to a lack of conviction and casual, happenstance tone. It's okay for a comedy to be this thoroughly jokey and loose, but the formula that worked for this franchise in the past was a tight balance of those lighter moments with sharp, dramatic action sets. MIB3 may go through those motions, but the emotional punch that its predecessor had delivered so easily is almost completely absent here. Though the vast majority of the film is set in the free love sixties, the atmosphere also remains very modern, like attending a themed costume party where the host didn't get the memo. Excepting a few very easy sight gags and the eyeball-rolling location of the film's grand climax, this just doesn't seem to make much effort to ground itself in that era. Josh Brolin works an uncanny Jones impression during these scenes, but that act falls strangely flat when the real deal himself was on-screen only moments before, and in this case there's really no substitute for the real thing. Quirky and fun, but terribly thin and uncertain... worth watching for the effects and frequent nods to its genre-mates, but it's really no better than the underwhelming Men in Black II.\",\n",

Unfortunately, if he were equally as adept at telling a story, his feature films would be at least twice as impressive. As it stands, last year's Immortals, his third film, is his worst effort thus far. The story, loosely based on Greek myth, follows the efforts of mortal king Hyperion, who embarks on a destructive campaign in hopes of locating a powerful bow once wielded by the Gods, and the outcast warrior Theseus who sets out to stop him with the help of an oracle. Recalling the hyperstylized graphic novel aesthetic of 300, Immortals contains a wealth of evocative imagery and technically impressive cinematography, but I found the story largely inert, with slack pacing and thin plotting that served primarily to fill the gaps between battles. In other words, it's a jumble of a tale told with spectacular visuals, and in still other words, it's par for the course for Tarsem Singh.\",\n",

The only thing more depressing than watching Rudd's poor, well-intentioned, passive hippie get repeatedly stomped into the mud is seeing how insufferably predictable the plot can become.

Turner), and Amera (J'Nara Corbin), all of whom are struggling with romantic issues of one kind or another. Added into the mix is toxic Jay, Greg's unwelcome roommate, played by Maurice Murrell.Murrell, of course, died suddenly earlier this year, aged just 32, so it's nice to be able to report he's one of the best things in this film - shamelessly stealing every scene as a poisonous bad boy bent on taking everyone in his path down with him.Moore is cute as pretty boy toy Faybien and, when he's given enough to do (blowing his top with Jay comes to mind), proves he can act. Corbin's Amera grates, however: she shrieks her way through the movie, bulldozing her way through every scene like a drunk drag queen in a funeral parlour. It's supposed to be funny, but every appearance has the same effect as fingernails on a blackboard. Dial it down next time - sometimes, less is more.The film's producers have decided a revenge attack on whitey is the best way to make up for lack of black visibility in gay cinema: The two white characters who appear are deliberately distasteful, particularly Jay's friend Neal. Intriguing that each and every one of the black actors are (more or less) dazzlingly attractive, whilst Neal is a nasty queen who looks like an anemic weasel. God bless separatist America and all who sail in her!Still, it falls to Neal to deliver one of the movie's most apt lines. I feel like I'm watching three different TV shows, he remarks during a disastrous dinner party. You are, Neal, and they all air in the daytime. This isn't cutting edge, arthouse cinema. It's not even mainstream cinema. It's sub-Noah's Arc soap, of the E. Lynn Harris variety, and pretty clumsy soap at that (the dinner party scene is the most idiotic, ill-conceived deus ex machina you're likely to see in a film).If endless deliberations about feelings and relationships are your bag, this is for you. Just don't take it too seriously: watch with friends, plenty of alcohol, and enjoy the cute boys. But really: gay cinema - and black gay cinema - can be so much better than this.\",\n",

They left out how those characters become more and more well-rounded as the movie goes on,  which is one of the movie's chief charms.Simply put, the alien invasion is extremely localized and effects the inhabitants of one council estate in south London.  As the characters first discover and fight the aliens,  we learn more about all of them,  and get our pants charmed off us, thanks to the cast of mostly unknowns.  That the movie didn't stick to literal black and white characterization is a bone of contention for some,  because some of the reviews dismissed the characters based on the first five minutes of the film, and ignored the rest of the movie, which served as a kind of atonement as they join forces and change alliances.I'd characterize it as mostly comedy with a bit of sci fi thrown in for fun,  with some often sharp little observations tossed in sneakily as the movie takes off. Oh, he's in Ghana, is it? Why can't he help the children of Britain? Not exotic enough? Not going to get a tan?

Gibson is excellent in this movie playing a mentally ill man.  As his life and family crumble under his depression, Walter Black (Gibson) finds a beaver puppet which he uses to try to get back to real life and his family.  The puppet speaks (in a Cockney accent) for him and is always with him.  This constant companionship is sometimes eerie, sometimes effective as therapy especially with his younger child, and is sometimes quite funny.  Black showers and makes love to his wife (Jodie Foster) with the beaver on his hand at all times, the absurdity of the situations playing off well against the shadow of his disease.  This is a dark movie with a serious theme, but there is unexpected humor in it, sometimes at the same moment as a bit of that darkness.The beaver puppet, which has unsettlingly penetrating eyes, helps Black back into his job and family life to some extent.  The movie way overplays the job part, though.  That he could make that kind of comeback with such a ridiculous product and be the apple of the media's eye was a stretch.  But the movie realistically goes on to show that the old illness is still there in Walter Black, as the beaver seems to take on a life of its own.  The ending?  A little hard to believe.  And yet in its own way the beaver is used by Black to make a last stand against his insanity.This is a movie with a well-written script, quite good acting (particularly Gibson's), and an absorbing mix of tragedy, struggle, and humor.

The barrage of rhyming couplets in the libretto from Richard Thomas (Jerry Springer the Opera) may clearly signal their intention to rhyme at the end with four-letter words and other mildly shocking profanities, but at the same time there is wit and pathos here in a libretto that actually manages to cut through the niceties directly to harsh crude reality of the circumstances of Anna Nicole Smith's life, unpalatable though that might be to the average opera-going audience.  Benjamin Britten and particularly Billy Budd comes to mind in the use of language, in its subject - which is also about a kind of loss of innocence on a bigger level than just the personal - and in Turnage's score, which also adopts his usual jazz and American influences, successfully finding the right tone for each occasion.The colourful, tastefully tacky set-designs by Richard Jones also adopt the right tone with plenty of eye-catching sights not commonly seen in an opera house, including a sequence in a lap-dancing parlour replete with artificial breast-enhanced women twirling themselves gymnastically and provocatively from poles.  The decision to present the opera as if it were a reality-TV show in which a chorus of TV hosts interview Anna Nicole, already dead but looking back over her life and tracing the path from smalltown girl to media celebrity that will ultimately lead to her destruction, is a masterstroke and it imbues the piece with a slightly sinister edge that grows as the opera proceeds.  The tone darkens considerably by the second half, when it does indeed become a tragedy, as the people in Smith's life disappear to be replaced by masses of ominous black figures with TV cameras for heads.Antonio Pappano, conducting the orchestra of the Royal Opera House, does well to allow the music score to assert its presence and not be overshadowed by the spectacle or the libretto.  Eva-Maria Westbroek is marvellous in the title role, and well supported by Gerald Finlay and Alan Oke.  As a Wagnerian soprano, Westbroek is however not really tested by the limited singing demands of the role, but she sings exceptionally well and manages to bring out the inherent humanity of her character, never letting her be merely an icon, nor indeed, allowing the performance to descend into parody.  Whether the opera ultimately has anything new to say or whether it touches on anything deeper in its subject - if indeed there anything deeper to be drawn from its subject - is questionable, but Anna Nicole demonstrates nonetheless that opera can still be a vital artform to address contemporary subjects in a powerful manner that can connect with a modern audience.On Blu-ray from Opus Arte, the opera - opening with a legal disclaimer that it is not intended to be an actual factual depiction of any person - looks every bit as bold as it should, the striking colours deeply saturated, with strong blacks and contrasts, and a good level of detail.  This often looks just stunning, and it is well filmed, picking out the singers at the right moments, while also allowing the overall impact of the set to be appreciated.  The audio tracks in PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 are also effective in allowing the detail of the musical arrangements to come through.  Subtitles are in English (so you can check that they actually sang what you thought they sang but couldn't quite believe), French, German and Spanish.  Aside from a Cast Gallery, the only other extra on the disc is a brief Production Report (8:25), introduced by Pappano, which nonetheless covers the development of the opera well with interviews with Turnage, Thomas and Westbroek.\",\n",
              "       \"Incredibly so, after about a century of movies production Norwegian Wood might be the first one that realistically shows human sexuality by focusing on its problems and deviations. Virtually all movies flat out ignore the prosaic but still severe pains of human sexuality by portraying it as something too easy to do and enjoy anywhere, in private and public (in an elevator, in shopping malls' dressing rooms, behind restaurant tables, etc.). Those scenes have been a male perspective, we -men- reach orgasm far easier than women, and even then movies have far exaggerated its easiness. And by those mean they have severely distorted the sexual expectations of whole generations starting in their youth (along with parents who couldn't tell their children that the media was lying to them)This is the first movie showing me a female perspective by focusing a lot on the character Naoko, her trauma and struggle to enjoy sexual pleasure. There are many ideas about how much of such pleasure women need, but it's a fact that sex is a rather frequent problem in many relations (maybe in most, but it's kept hidden) everywhere literally and also fact that many men may go insane without such pleasure. This was Naoko's situation, indeed.It should be a scandal that it's been only until now that one director bothered to approach this issue. Ultimately, movie directors mostly follow the crowds. Right here, it's only me pointing Naoko's frigidity. Everyone else has focused in the same old, same old topic in almost all fiction works: death, death, death and some additional comments on the movie's sexiness, smartness, and the like in this much ignored movie. Well, you'll get to see a corpse here, happy?The movie surely has more characters and topics, still revolving around sex. This is not a XXX movie at all, though; don't expect many racy scenes.

On the surface, all appears well for a fisherman and his devoted wife who are expecting their first baby. The hero is a hardworking and respected member of his community, which holds fast to rigid traditions. There is one wrinkle - he is also devoted to his male lover. A catastrophic accident does not erase the presence of his lover, as the fisherman must now contend with the apparitions of his forbidden love and the gossip and disapproving stares of his neighbors. And it may go without saying - his wife isn't too pleased either.'Miguel (Cristian Mercado) is the little fisherman who seems to have it all - a loving wife Mariela (Tatiana Astengo), a solid group of friends and family, and the incipient birth of his first child.  But Miguel is a closeted gay man/bisexual who is in love with a painter/photographer, the handsome Santiago (Manolo Cardona) who seems content to maintain a relationship with Miguel in secret.  But there is an accident in which one of Miguel's young friends dies and Miguel is asked by the family to prepare the body for burial, carry the boy on a bamboo stretcher, offer a eulogy and then take the body out to sea to bury it in the water - an old tradition in this small Peruvian fishing village that assures that the dead person's soul will find rest.Santiago takes photos of the funeral procession and it is obvious that the townspeople gossip about the painter - a man who paints pictures and is not married is suspect and homophobia rages.  As Mariela gives birth to their son Miguelito, Miguel is torn between his devotion to his wife and son and his desire for Santiago's physical presence.  In a series of beautifully realized love scenes between the two men it is obvious that there is a struggle on the part of both Miguel and Santiago: they love each other but that love is forbidden.  Santiago appears to Miguel one night and says that he is dead, that Miguel is the sole person able to see Santiago's ghost. This allows Miguel and Santiago to be together in the village, as  Santiago cannot be seen: they are able at last to love each other in the open.  But the village discovers that the missing Santiago's home contained nude paintings of men - men who appear to be images of Miguel.  The village treats Miguel as an outcast, his wife is outraged and leaves, and Miguel feels he has lost everything. Santiago's family come to claim the body and Miguel finally has the courage to be the man he really is.  The film ends with a deeply moving tradition upheld.Both Cristian Mercado and Manolo Cardona  handle their difficult roles brilliantly: their physical chemistry is visceral and their dealing with the Peruvian prejudice is poignant.  But each of the actors is excellent.  The cinematography by  Mauricio Vidal captures the flavor of the Peruvian seaside and the many underwater scenes are breathtaking. Selma Mutal Vermeulen provides the musical score that is the perfect balance of folksongs and background music. But in the end it is writer/director Javier Fuentes-Le&oacute;n  who deserves the kudos for a brilliant film that took considerable courage to make.  Hopefully we will be seeing more of his work in the near future.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, June 11\",\n",

Martin Freeman blew a painful stab into the core of an artistic play with his annoying facial expressions, annoying body motion, and long and boring appearances in many empty scenes. Among the most inconvenient long scenes came near the end in a  play of a riddle with a skinned creature, in the grooves of the cave.The entire plot sounded like a child's narration, revolving in circles, from one episode of violence, followed by quite events yet to enter the next episode of violence, with no apparent goal other than the confusion of the moviemaker about the way to cram the movie with action animations, unconnected by any engaging causation.Starting from Hobbit in his old age with is his son, writing a fictional dream, supposedly fascinating in imagination, followed by time travel 60 years to young Hobbit. As the premise of fascination unfolds, the fiction revolves on mountain beats, witches, past monarchs, and legendary societies. There was no apparent valuable lesson to be learned.Martin Freeman (Hobbit) left the viewer with the inescapable feeling of being fooled with an actor fascinated by self grandiosity, dressed in contemporary man's clothing with intermingling with fictional characters.Taken individually,each scene and each work of art conveyed great sense of mastery and intrigue, all lost to poor planning of flow of events or staging purposeful climaxes.The many glorious animations of palaces, caves, gold treasures, and natural scenes, were all wasted with the improper flow of episodes of waring, invasion, and exotic mountainous scenes. The gigantic monsters turning into stones with a witches trick, or the exotic ocs, driven by monsters, or the many suspended wooden bridges, gigantic flying eagles, all turned the screen onto ongoing chaos.Mohamed F.

After horrific car accident in which his wife dies, father of two girls has to deal with his and their grief.  Five months after the accident they decide to leave Chicago and go to Genoa, Italy where his old college friend (beautifully played by Catherine Keener) finds him a summer job at the local university.Story unravels from here.  Each one of them has to come to terms with their loss.  They use their senses, new environment and beauty of Italy to deal with their grief and sadness.  Surely, their loss is too fresh, not even a year has passed and there seem to be opportunities of all kinds for each one of them to search for their peace: swimming in beautiful sea, visiting historical sites, taking piano lessons, learning Italian and of course, seeking physical pleasures to compensate for their emotional loss.Like in most stories, real or not, it takes only one critical moment to re-unite this fragmented family and reconcile their lives.  This is wonderful film with great performances and breathtaking views of Italian town of Genoa.  It is a story of loss and search for redemption, peace and new start.',\n",
              "       \"Look, the appeal of this film could not be any more obvious. But if you're somehow, for whatever psychotic reason, on the fence about seeing it, just read this paragraph and answer the question that follows:Sylvester Stallone, Chuck Norris, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Jason Statham, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Bruce Willis walk into a room with lots of things that can explode. They shoot everything in the room while cracking amusing one-liners at each other, quite a few in-jokes, and totally absurd noise and action. Jean-Claude Van Damme has a one-on-one showdown with Stallone at one point.I just described exactly what the point of this movie is in three sentences. There is nothing else that needs to be said. So, ask yourself, does this scenario appeal to you, or are you of such astoundingly poor judgment that you expected something different, much in the same way someone looking at a clear day would expect a sky colored something other than blue? If yes, great. Ignore everyone else and go see it, you'll be entertained. If not, you're so narcissistic you never would have liked this film to begin with at any point, and your ego is eating itself if you give this film a poor review on grounds it never promised in the first place.The only real problem in this film is that it's lacking in the Jet Li department. Which is really unfortunate, as he was great in the first one. Not sure what happened there, but he's not around for most of the film, which sort of sucks. So if you're here to see Li and to not see him would make you cry regardless of anything else, you should not watch this film.That's as deep as it goes. If you saw it by choice, then you expected correctly what the film was going to deliver all along. If you expected differently, short of being deceived by someone else who lied about what the COVER was about, then it's very likely that you're suffering from a severe psychosis and could benefit from treatment. You're also probably a harsh critic of the Transformers films and referred to them as dumb action flicks as an insult. This is an added indication that you should never review anything, ever again, because you've failed to develop the basic cognitive ability to know that people can enjoy exactly those films, and your opinion on movies may as well be a review on how provolone cheese is better than Swiss cheese. It's just as valid, really.\",\n",

              "       \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes may be the first film of the summer that has surpassed reasonable expectations and delivered a completely compelling story along with amazing special effects and credible suspense. Make no mistake this is anything but a cheap capitalization on a known franchise but instead works exceptionally well as a standalone movie that will leave audiences hoping that the journey can continue beyond the satisfying conclusion.The story begins with a geneticist (James Franco) who is working on a cure for Alzheimer's disease with testing being done on chimps. A breakthrough is made when one in particular shows signs of greatly increased intelligence however due to an incident the test subjects are eliminated except for a baby that Franco's character secretly takes home and raises with his Alzheimer's suffering father. They name him Caesar and the relationships built are genuine and provide that connection so critical in order to increase the impact of events later in the film.The drug that was given to the apes in the lab was passed on to Caesar through his mom. Eventually he outgrows the domestic situation and his protective instincts take over which results in him being forced into a sanctuary and amongst other apes - a foreign situation considering he had only lived with humans and never had any interaction with his own species. After a rough start there he begins the revolution by uniting the apes and leading an escape.Caesar is very much the lead character in the movie, and though Franco's character provides an emotional attachment and the presence that ties the developments together and lead Caesar down his path, it's quite possible that not a single human character's name will be remembered. They take a backseat to Caesar and the apes who are fascinating to watch not just in their actions but in the way they can deliver their emotions, thoughts, and communicate without needing dialogue to do so.That is a huge credit to Andy Serkis who once again comes through with amazing performances that were captured and then animated over. There is no understating how fantastic the special effects for the apes are and how important that is - it would be much more difficult to sympathize with their plights otherwise. It's always appreciated when a film can place the audience in a position where they have to question what side they are actually rooting for because all those involved can justify their actions in some form or fashion.Though it works completely on its own there are also some great callbacks to the Planet of the Apes of the past. One in particular is somewhat distracting but is followed by probably the most powerful moment in the film so it can't be faulted for that too much. Fans of the prior installments will appreciate all of those instances otherwise.The movie is most surprising in its sincerity as it provides a compelling character study of Caesar. Beyond that it could leave audiences questioning the morality of testing and the general perception of other species as humans sit atop of the food chain - thankfully it never preaches on any of those subjects however. By challenging the audience and leaving them invested in the outcome, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is the most satisfying film this summer has had to offer.\",\n",

The film features voice actors not as well known as other Pixar films, but the cinematography alone will blow your mind for an animated film. Yes, the characters look cartoonish, but everything else (the sets, costumes, atmosphere, even the weather) look SO real and beautiful that this film is worth owning on that point alone. This film was probably the darkest Pixar movie I've seen up until this point; I think they were going for a much more serious and mysterious plot line instead of some of their earlier, &#34;brighter&#34; films like Cars or Toy Story.

There's some B plot about a terrorist-slash-bad guy after them that wouldn't even pass for a filler episode of CSI. The script borrows heavily from True Lies but fails to copy the good parts that make it work, leaving us with a film that lurches violently from shooting five guys at point blank range to soppy scenes with The Witherspoon. In the midst of this, her character spends the entire film pondering the dilemma of dating two guys while her exposition sidekick Chelsea Handler gives her someone to talk to.Anyone who really works for the CIA must roll their eyes when they see poorly researched and frankly unbelievable nonsense like this. If you think the Secret Service's call girl incident in Colombia was bad, a single day in McG's intelligence agency involves wiretapping people you date, starting shootouts in Hong Kong and basically doing anything but your job (all Angela Bassett's watch, too). It makes John McClane look like a real-life cop.None of this would really matter if the characters were engaging and it was fun - but given the quality of actors here, they all phone it in and the level of chemistry is pretty low. There are a couple of enjoyable moments but the plot is oh so predictable and formulaic. I'm all for brainlessly fun date flicks but seriously, a modicum of quality really goes a long way.\",\n",

              "       \"Despite its obvious budgetary constraints, writer/director Ryan Richmond serves up a surprisingly complex and ambitious narrative in Money Matters.  Knowing nothing at all about the film, I went into the experience a complete blank with little expectation.  And while the movie is far from perfect, it has a reach, intimacy, and sophistication that made me want to overlook any apparent shortcomings.  In a story that has elements of coming-of-age drama, family dysfunction, cautionary tale, and redemptive morality play--this little ninety minute presentation attempts more than you might anticipate.  In fact, there is enough significant content to fuel several different projects.  Sometimes the film pushes a bit too hard (I probably could have lived without the dramatic illness that takes over the film's finale), but I will never fault a filmmaker that has too many ideas and ambitions in this world of empty-headed movie making by committee.At the heart of the picture is a strong and complicated mother/daughter dynamic.  Aunjanue Ellis (getting a chance to shine) plays the mother, a troubled soul dealing with abusive relationships and a sordid past that was populated with drug use and prostitution.  Still fighting every day, she has been committed to giving her daughter (Terri Abney) a better opportunity than she had.  Abney plays Monique Money Matters and it is one of the more complex portraits of adolescence that you're likely to see.  Introspective and socially awkward, Abney has a defiant but loving relationship with her mother (who has turned to a religious mania in the search for strength).  But her primary journey is one of self-discovery, just who is she and where does she fit in?  As Abney starts to be pushed by teachers and a new bond with a local girl, her independence and confidence start to shine.  But as unsavory elements that haunt the two women's past start to surface, Abney must confront some unpleasant truths.  Can these realizations set her free or might they destroy her?Although filled with great ideas, the dialogue (as I mentioned) can sometimes feel a bit forced or stilted.  Ultimately, though, there is no denying the power and emotion behind the piece.  Ellis has a meaty role and she really attacks the disparate emotions behind it.  Abney is allowed a quieter, more subtle approach.  As her strength emerges gradually, you're invested in her journey.  This mother/daughter bond is one of the primary reasons to watch Money Matters.  Ryan Richmond seems to have a great instinct and if this showcase is any indication, I expect to see more of this talented filmmaker.  A strong contemporary urban drama, I hope this little film can find a wide audience on DVD.  This is for viewers looking for complicated and rewarding storytelling outside of traditional mainstream cinema.  KGHarris, 11/11.\",\n",

What was once humorous has degraded into old fashioned sexism and over-used clich&eacute;s. Seriously, since when did anyone laugh at Masuka's jokes?

The story now jumps to 1973 as Javier, now a blobby man in his 40s, joins a circus as the sad clown. The happy clown is Sergio, an absolute brute who drinks and beats his girlfriend Natalia. Sergio is the star attraction of the circus. Javier falls for Natalia and attracts the wrath of Sergio. The rest of the story is better seen than described.Iglesia tells his story in images, and his inventiveness never flags. The opening credits and the initial battle form the most visually dynamic opening sequence I've seen in years, and the final ten minutes or so are just as strong. Iglesia doesn't just string together eye-catching scenes for their own sake; he maintains a strong storyline throughout, albeit it's a story that can be a bit loopy and improbable. The only problem with this film is that it's filled, I assume, with political commentary and symbolism that's completely opaque to a non-Spaniard such as myself. This didn't lessen my enjoyment of the film, it just annoyed me to think that if I was Spanish I'd be enjoying it even more. The Last Circus is one of those films that celebrates that fact that film is a visual medium first and foremost, and not just a recording device for dialogue and images cooked up in a computer.You can read more of my reviews at JettisonCocoon dot com.\",\n",

Rider had already written his Allan Quartermain novels as well as She, but the birth of the first action hero wasn't until 1912 with Edgar Rice Burroughs's science fiction fantasy (published in a mens magazine) A Princess of Mars (two years before Tarzan the Ape Man). Here we see the first super hero/fighting man that inspired not only Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers, Rocky Jones, Commando Cody, Captain Kirk, Luke Skywalker and Starbuck but also inspired Superman, Batman, Captain America, Green Lantern, The Lone Ranger, Thor, Iron Man, Green Hornet and Indiana Jones (with a little Allan Quartermain dashed in for flavor!). Larger than life heroes battling impossible odds, possessing special skill sets or an arsenal of weaponry (usually borrowed from the bad guys) and then there's the beautiful princess that needed rescuing and the arena of death plot device are all from the feverish mind of Mr. Burroughs.John Carter, a Virginia gentleman dies in a cave during an Indian War and then wakes up on Mars wearing only his birthday suit, which is okay because everyone else on Mars (Barsoom) prefers their birthday suits as well (harnesses and insignia are usually all any of them wear) and then he goes about conquering the bad guys that later inspired Ming, the Draconians, the Cylons, the Klingons, the Romulans, the Emperor and even Darth Vader; this list is endless because it would also include Sinestro, Lex Luthor, Ra's Al Ghul, Red Skull, Dr. Doom, The Mandarian, Loki, Baltar and Butch Cavindish. You see where this is going...There are fifteen-foot tall, four-armed creatures with nasty underbitten tusks, flying skiffs, swordplay, incredible jumping and wicked explosions...oh, and the incomprable Dejah Thoris being kidnapped as a matter of routine (much the way Jane was in Tarzan); there are cavalry officers, apache Indians, warring tribes, psycho priests, forgotten gods, dictators, assassins, thieves, mad doctors, chessmen, would-be rapists, warriors, weird mating rituals, great white apes, vast deserts, inter-special mating (and the children thereof) and the occasional introduction by Mr. Burroughs himself. And that's just the 11 books that comprise the Martian Tales.This movie actually blends elements of the first three books, A Princess of Mars, The Gods Of Mars and The Warlord of Mars, and is a feast for the eyes. The imagery reflects the literature in many areas, regardless of the usual theatrical changes experienced from the translation of book-to-screen. I was thoroughly impressed, moreso because I've grown bored with Disney's inability to rise above dorky kiddie fare; however, Disney allayed all of my fears of a dumbbed-down travesty and gave me something that sits proudly among the children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of celluoid if which it inspired. Of course, Disney now has Marvel and its lengthy host of heroes and villains to lavish the screen with like the Avengers (Captain America, Iron Man and Thor).Herein lies the swordplay of Flash Gordon and Luke Skywalker; herein lies the much-lusted after princesses Ardala, Aura and Leia (don't forget Padme, can't forget her!); herein lies the grandiose battles of Mongol, Tatooine and all points spaceward; herein lies giant monsters and deadly arenas that leering villains like Ming, Count Dooku, Killer Kane, the Klingons or Jabba the Hut are entertained with prior to their downfall; herein lies the skiffs, gadgets and back backs of Commando Cody, Buck Rogers, Bobba Fett and Imperial Biker Scouts; herein lies the genesis of so much that we take for granted.I've heard people tell me that John Carter rips off Star Wars, Star Trek and blah blah blah, but this only shows the limits of a literature-starved America within the vast wasteland of dullness.John Carter, cavalry officer of Virginia, Warlord of Barsoom and betroved of the incomprable Dejah Thoris is the great-great-grandaddy of all the action heroes of the 20th Century pop culture.Thank you, Disney, for doing something totally cool!A Princees of Mars was previously made as a low-budget Scy Fy TV movie (2009) starring the still lovely Traci Lords as Dejah Thoris and Antonio Sabato Jr. as an Iraq War-era John Carter; nothing at all like the recent John Carter but rather faithful to the plot of the first book.John Carter is Charlton Heston's real name but he changed it so it wouldn't be confused with the Burroughs's character; Heston's career seemed to parallel his literary namesake (Colonel George Taylor of Planet of the Apes is another of those classic action heroes).There is an even longer pedegree of the origin of the great action hero of legend (King Arthur, anyone?) we could delve into, but we'll leave this exploration for now and revel in the excitement of yesterday's hero exploding on the screen today.5 stars and beyond!\",\n",

This is one original and touching project, which stars Mickey Rourke, Megan Fox and Bill Murray - quite fascinating casting.Mickey Rourke plays Nate, a famous, has-been trumpet player, who we meet at the beginning of the film. He just finished a gig, and just when he was getting ready to go home, somebody hits him on the head. Next thing, he is in the Mexican desert, ready to be executed by a hit man. Amazingly, some strangers save him, just about when he was ready to say goodbye for good. However, he is left alone, without transportation or means of communication, wandering in the desert. Eventually, he finds a traveling carnival in the middle of nowhere, where he meets Lily, an incredibly beautiful woman, who happens to have wings - a bird woman, she calls herself. He falls for her and tries to take her away. Unfortunately, he is discovered by Sam (Rhys Ifans), the owner of the carnival, who will not allow his main attraction to be taken away. Amazingly again, just when Nate is going to be whacked by Sam, he is saved at the last minute, this time by Lily herself. They run away, with Sam promising to get her back. Once in the city, Nate makes a deal with Happy Shannon (Bill Murray), a gangster, to spare his life and debt, and make some profit together, by using Lily in an attraction, namely a lucrative freak. Sadly for Nate, things don't go as planned, and he will soon realize his mistake.Passion Play is different, and, as I said, original. It plays as a fantasy, and should be watched as such.

But that turns out to be a fairly small part of the movie, actually.  In fact, on a political level, the film is more of an indictment of a legal system wherein a person who inadvertently causes a woman to have a miscarriage can be charged with the murder of that child.But politics and social reform take a back seat in the movie to its human drama, as writer/director Asghar Farhadi provides us with a naturalistic tale of ordinary, decent people trying - but often failing - to lead ordinary, decent lives in a world too often ruled by the cruel exigencies of random chance.Simin (Leila Hatami) is seeking a divorce from her husband, Nader (Peyman Moaddi).  It's not that she really wants a divorce; it's that she wants the two of them to move out of the country with their 11-year-old daughter, Termeh (Sarina Fahadi), to seek a more promising future for themselves somewhere else, but Nader wants to stay in the country to take care of his father who is suffering from Alzheimer's.  However, the judge deems that there are not sufficient grounds in this case to grant a divorce.  When Simin moves back in with her parents, Nader is forced to hire a woman (Sareh Bayat) to take care of his father during the day while he's at work.  It is at that point that the real trouble begins.I don't want to give much more of the plot away than that; suffice it to say, the movie is a realistic drama made up of characters who are neither heroes nor villains, sinners nor saints.  There's plenty of blame to go around for what happens in the story - and at times it feels a bit like an episode of Adults Behaving Badly - but Farhadi always make us aware of just how flawed but well-intentioned these wholly recognizable figures are.  Their customs and religious beliefs may seem a bit foreign to Western eyes, but the issues of marital discord, of caring for an elderly parent, of trying but often failing at being a role model for one's children, and of refusing to accept the consequences of one's actions are universal in their scope and nature.There's a certain redundancy in the narrative and an occasional flatness in the storytelling, but excellent performances and a bravely inconclusive, lady-or-the-tiger fadeout hold us in the movie's thrall.\",\n",

It features fun action sequences, great dialogue, thrilling situations and (best of all) well drawn characters you can understand and want to root for!The plot of 'X-Men: First Class' takes the series back in time as we see young mutants Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr as they grow up from the 1940's to the 1960's. Charles is a privileged Oxford graduate who has the mutant ability to read minds. Erik is a Holocaust surviver who's hunting down the men who murdered his family, in particular Sabastian Shaw who tortured him into using his magnetic mutant abilities. The main story begins in 1962 where the U.S. government has learned that Shaw is leading a group of mutants and trying to achieve world domination. They have Charles and Erik to track down other mutants to start a team of their own to combat Shaw.The story of 'X-Men: First Class' plays out well in a comic book sort of way. The mixing of real events like the 'Holocaust' and the 'Cuban Missile Crisis' seem a bit odd but it gives way for some interesting period detail (and some great nods to the old 'James Bond' films!). There are a lot of moments that feel a bit rushed (the whole movie was rushed in production) and we don't get much story or connection behind Charles and Erik's super-team (or Shaw's for that matter) but the relationship and conflict between Charles and Erik really drives 'X-Men: First Class' home. They are strangers who become friends who become close as brothers. There's one powerful scene in particular where Erik and Charles share a good moment in Erik's memory that in any other hands than director Matthew Vaughn would seem too awkward for an action/superhero film.Again, while the story is great 'X-Men: First Class' wouldn't be nearly as compelling if it wasn't for outstanding performances of the three main leads. James McAvoy is one of my favorite actors and he brings warmth, humanity and humor to Charles and has you rooting for him despite his sometimes naivety. Michael Fassbender is both intense and dashing as Erik (if this is his 007 audition I think he's got the part!) and makes you more than understand his quest for revenge. Kevin Bacon seems right at home as Shaw and raises his character above the usual 'power-hungry' villain (it's a treat hearing him and Fassbender speak in multiple languages!). Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult do good work at bringing out the relationship between Raven and Hank, but like the other actors really aren't given enough to do.'X-Men:First Class' is by no means a perfect film and has some obvious flaws (feels rushed, too many side-characters and tries to cram too much into a little over two hours) but it's a great piece of entertainment. With so many superhero films coming out this year it's nice to see one with some real weight to it. Highly recommended!\",\n",

              "       \"Ava Duvernay's I Will Follow is a breath of fresh air in a stale period of African-American cinema. I Will Follow is a beautifully crafted film that features multidimensional characters, beautiful cinematography and a thought-provoking plot. I haven't seen a Black film made with this level of quality in over a decade. This is one of the best films of 2011.Salli Richardson-Whitfield gives one of her finest performances as Maye, the niece of Amanda, a background drummer for some of the most popular musicians of the70's and 80's. After taking a year off to care for her dying aunt, she has one day to pack up all the belongings in the home she shared with her and we watch as twelve strangers help her pack her belongings into a truck and help her move forward with her life.I Will Follow is a great movie. It's rare that we get to see these slices of African-American life presented onscreen, a film where we see African-Americans as multidimensional people, expressing themselves as human beings, not like caricatures and stereotypes. This is the kind of story about Black life we hear about all the time, but it's rarely ever shown onscreen in the media. It's very rare that Black actors are given material of this quality and an opportunity to perform playing multidimensional characters like this in today's media. This is the kind of African-American film I want to see made, and if I made films this would be the kind of film I would make.The screenwriting on this film is top notch. Many say Duvernay's story is slow, but I have no problem with the pacing of this movie. The storyline is very subtle and nuanced showing us those little things in life so many of us take for granted. It's the kind of story that can easily go over people's heads if they're not paying attention.I've always enjoyed Salli Richardson Whitfield's work. But she takes her craft to another level with her powerful performance in I Will Follow. Richardson effortlessly carries the film from fade in to fade out in her portrayal of Maye, a woman who has to hold it together in the face of so much. It's the little things in Richardson's performance that are great to watch in I Will Follow, the looks on her face, the way she carries herself with a quiet dignity, the way she conveys kindness and compassion as she handles a stressful situation. Richardson has great chemistry with every actor onscreen and makes us feel a connection to all the people who she interacts with throughout the day.The supporting cast is also very strong. Beverly Todd gives a dignified and elegant performance as Amanda, a woman who wants to end her life on her own terms. Michole Briana White is very strong as Fran, the Daughter who had a strained relationship with her mother, but is angry about the close relationship Amanda had with Maye. You feel her jealousy and anger at Maye throughout her time onscreen. When she and Richardson are on screen there's intensity and tension. Dijon Halton is solid in his role as Raven, a good kid who sticks around to help Maye. I love the conversation he has with Maye about Nas and Jay-z; it's the kind of conversation people have in real life. Omari Hardwick is solid as a potential love interest for Maye and Blair Underwood gives one of his strongest performances in a small role as Maye's former lover. There are so many great performances here, like the two Goodwill guys who add some humor and the Cancer Survivor who takes down the satellite dish adds some warmth and humanity. I wish I could mention everyone, because the entire cast does an amazing job of supporting this film.I really appreciate this film and what it represents historically for Black Cinema. I Will Follow was independently financed and independently produced. More importantly, it was the first Black film independently distributed to theaters by a black distributor. Made for just $50,000 and shot in just six days I Will Follow looks like a film that cost over $40 million minimum. The cinematography on this film is beautiful with serene shots and powerful visuals that tell a strong story the viewer will never forget. Duvernay tells a great story with her camera, and her first film has me eager to see more of her work.I Will Follow is a Shawn James Five Star Essential Video. Pick this up today!\",\n",

Unlike his New Police Story or Shaolin, Director Benny Chan takes a more light-hearted approach to the familiar story about good and evil, with special effects-ridden fights between a superhero and supervillains, but the end result is really a mixed bag.The film is about Sunny (Aaron Kwok), a clown of a traveling circus troupe (and a son of a renowned knife throwing master). One day, while looking for gold in a Malaysian cave, he and other circus members including circus troupe leader Zhang Dachu (Collin Chou) are exposed to the chemical gas developed by the Japanese army just before WWII ended.But you may skip the dull introductory part. About 40 minutes in, the real story begins with Zhang Dachu and his gang, who have transformed into superhuman monsters robbing the jewelry stores and banks in Hong Kong; and Sunny, who gained superhuman powers apparently without changing physical appearance. Shu Qi plays Angel, a TV reporter covering the story of Sunny. Wu Jing and Zhang Jingchu are special agents.The film has a few action set-pieces that are watchable but not remarkable. Wu Jing and Collin Chou show what they can do in the martial arts action scenes, but there are not many, and cheesy special effects of flying knives do not help. Aaron Kwok's reluctant hero remains uninteresting, and so does Shu Qi's opportunistic reporter.

I think a lot of that can be attributed to the presence of Guy Pearce in the lead role of Snow, a wrongfully disgraced CIA agent in the year 2079.  Pearce seems like the most unlikeliest of action heroes but on sheer attitude he pulls it off.  Snow is as quick with a quip as he is with a gun.

Adapted from Emily Griffin's novel by the same name by Jennie Snyder and directed by Luke Greenfield, it rolls our a story of misbegotten romance and circumstances, adds a conscience commentator, throws in a far too desperate man chaser, adds an obnoxious but harmless nerd, and plows along a romance twist that seems to run on too long.Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin, in a role far above her first job as an actress as the chubby girl in 'Mona Lisa Smile') is a lawyer who in law school had a crush on a fellow law student Dex (Colin Egglesfield) but happened to introduce him to her lifelong best friend Darcy (Kate Hudson) who promptly snapped him up and is now a few years later planning her wedding to him. Rachel's best male friend is writer Ethan (John Krasinski) and is the one in whom Rachel confides the fact that she still is in love with Dex.  At a bar party (and there are MANY of these in the film) Rachel and Dex collide and discover their private longings for each other.  In back and forth flashbacks of their pasts we see a strong unspoken love between these two and when it finally consummates before the wedding of Dex to Darcy, problems arise. There are trips to the Hamptons with a lot more drinking and misbehavior and the introduction of nerdy Marcus (Steve Howey) and man-hungry Claire (Ashley Williams) and the seemingly ever-present smart Ethan doling out unheard advice: his lines offer the only sane and realistic opinions about the random silliness of contemporary 'relationships' and Krasinski does this very well.  Things work out just as you would expect them to - irresponsible behavior on most everyone's part, enough potty mouth to keep the script up to current standards, no surprises, but there is some charm. We learn about loyalties and we learn about love.  And that is probably enough for a film of this nature.Kate Hudson is once again in the role of a loud mouthed shallow character (an she has that role polished to a fare-thee-well), Ginnifer Goodwin proves she can manage a lead role, John Krasinki gives one of the best all around performances int he film, and Colin Egglesfield is more than just eye candy.

              "       \"Ask yourself this question: Is it possible to make a scene emotional by the music, words, and the sadness in your face and demeanor without breaking your voice and sobbing through half of the lyrics?The pure heartbreak of the song Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again was never do to some gasping in between the notes or a dramatic flinging wide of the performer's arms; not to me. A gentle, wistful and defeated depiction of grief is often more moving than a sobbing, almost hysterical one. When someone is not crying aloud in agony, often it is not because they haven't reached that level of pain yet; it is because they have moved beyond it.Sierra Boggess unfortunately ruins the sting of that song with her overacting and disjointed singing. Her voice would be absolutely lovely were she not constantly breaking it in a sob or gasp of pain. Similarly, in some of the other songs she sings (Think of Me and All I Ask of You), she interrupts her own voice with quick breaths of nervousness or excitement. All this while flinging herself about in a wild manner that is not necessary even for a huge audience. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. However, I must add that in the last two songs, Past the Point of No Return and The Final Lair, her acting improves considerably, and she is actually quite convincing as being heartbroken in the last scene. Her singing, too, is not so broken or exaggerated. In other words she seems to have calmed down a bit.Hadley Fraser's acting is actually quite good; but his voice seems often strained on the low notes and rather than being gentle and soothing as perhaps Raoul's voice ought to be, it made me feel tense and uncomfortable.On the other hand, Ramin Karimloo gives a quite literally stunning performance. He seems to be able to change his voice from one of powerful command to an incredibly soft and smooth lilt. I did not know one person could have so versatile a voice. He has the necessary high range for the songs he sings without having a thin voice, and his acting performance is often wild, insane, and abrupt; in other words, very good for the part he is playing. In his case, excessive theatrics are not unwelcome: the Phantom has mostly lost his mind and being wild and impulsive is warranted. But this does not often intrude into his wonderful vocals, and he commands the eyes not because of random changes of volume which cause you to turn to look at him just to see who on earth just punched him in the gut, but rather because you want to pay sufficient enough attention to catch his every glorious note and because you must see what he will do next as his character is obviously very unstable. He also gives an incredibly touching performance in the final scene where his character is brought back to sanity by love, even bringing tears to my eyes.The filming of this 25th Anniversary Edition is wonderfully done; rarely have I seen a stage performance so masterfully captured. The props and effects used on stage are all quite real looking and the way some of the scenes were set up was very inventive.The music and story of The Phantom of the Opera are always powerful, beautiful and moving. It is actually my favorite musical, and definitely worth seeing; however, I would recommend finding a different version. Perhaps this one is worth watching on the basis of the effects, filming, and Ramin Karimloo's performance alone; but I suggest checking it out at the library or renting it before buying.\",\n",
              "       \"Pixar's first tale to center on a female heroine introduces us to Merida, who is, ironically enough, an adventurous tomboy. She loathes her loving mother (the queen) for pushing her into the very feminine royal life laid out for her based on the traditions of her people. This resentment eventually boils over, and Merida rides off into the woods in an act of protest. During this glorified tantrum, she stumbles upon a mysterious group of stones and magical blue 'wisp' creatures. These beings lead Merida to the cabin of a bumbling witch with a penchant for spells. Merida strikes a deal with her to 'change her destiny' in exchange for a valuable necklace. Of course the new destiny is worse than her original one so Merida spends the rest of the movie trying to, as Bay-Staters know how to say all too well, 'reverse the curse!'As usual for Pixar, the animation is nothing short of breathtaking. A young girl sitting behind me at the theater gasped So beautiful! when the film opened to a stunning shot of an animated Scottish coastal community. The way the animators craft the different settings for our characters in such vivid color and detail is almost worth the price of admission alone...almost.Where the film falters is with both the overall pacing and with the development of an antagonist. The beginning of the movie seems to drag, especially for a fairy tale geared at young children. The first hour could have been told in half the time, and gets quite repetitive as it drives home the point that Merida is not happy with her life. She is like the child version of Elizabeth Gilbert from Eat, Pray, Love - both being whiny characters that have so much yet want something different. Once Brave does begin to move along plotwise, it becomes a disjointed tale in search of a villain. Is it the witch? The demon bear? The queen? Merida herself? Maybe all of them? The narrative doesn't take the time to establish any one evil to root against, which leaves older, more mature viewers a little impartial to the outcome.For a story so lacking in a developed villain, it is surprisingly violent, taking advantage of every last bit of the 'PG' rating. From constant sword/fist/bear fights to one character getting crushed to death by a large stone, I was taken aback by how far Pixar took the intensity of this story. While other Pixar movies have had dramatic scenes, this one strikes me as the first I would say real young children would not enjoy seeing. I wish the film had leaned more on the humor, because when Brave tries to be funny, it succeeds brilliantly. There are a few comical sequences with devious little triplets that save the film from being a complete disaster.All that criticism aside, this is a perfect movie for preteen/middle school girls who can handle cartoon violence and want an ultimately positive message. For the rest of us, Pixar's latest is simply a disappointing Scottish legend that borrows from better animated films of a similar vein (see the far superiorSpirited Away). It's not the worst way to spend your money at the multiplex, but it's certainly not worth rushing out to see if you aren't in the target demographic. In my movie-going opinion, I would give it a 5 out of 10.\",\n",

Along the way there's a bar fights, flying horses, trespassing on distant lands, long treks up glacial mountain tops, snow sprites and ferocious Frost sentries, leagues of Amazonian maiden warriors, a flaming sword, an avenging Dark Elf and armies marching upon the grounds of Asgard.I don't miss the Thor of the comic book pages, this is like an illustrated page from The Lord of The Rings with all of the pomp and adventure.In addition to this hour and fifteen minute movie is a fascinating documentary on the Making of.This is a great introduction to the comic book hero, but unfortunately it's so good that any other Thor has to be reworked in light of it.THOR: TALES OF ASGARD, 5 very, very big stars.\",\n",

There is no law that can be made to end this. What we have here is proof of several things, the most glaring are the following two, which should have been delved into by the film:1.The semi-psychotic Asst. Principals and School Superintendants, all eager to say to bully and victim, shake hands, and be friends when their refusal-to-see-the-problem actually exacerbates the frustration in the bullied child. In one particular scene, the bullied child shows more insight and intelligence than the Asst Principal, a common occurance in todays schools.2.The parental cowardice that hangs like a pall over many of these children's lives is never even looked at. In one instance, the bullied child is subtly judged as inadequate by his own parents, and those same parents make no effort to actually prepare the child to stand up for himself; instead asking almost derisively, Do you like to get hit? If your kid starts lifting the most simple weights till the muscle burns, he'll add muscle very quickly. Just doing that can add confidence. Add to that the admonition that you're not made of glass, and maybe the bully can beat you up, but let him know you'll get in your punches too, and they'll stop picking on you. Somehow, this is never even mentioned.I raised 4 boys. One came to me admitting his fear of a bully. I explained a simple UNPLEASANT truth: Cowards die many times before their death; the valiant taste of death but once. I told my son, it's OK to be scared, be aware that your knees are shaking, just curl your fingers into a fist so hard that when your fist starts to hurt so much you cant stand it, and at that point you drive your fist into the other boy's face. He did exactly that (off school property) and never had another problem.Yes, it's a wonderful notion that all schoolchildren should rally together and help the bullied. I support that 110%, but the human being has to try to help himself. Whoever said friends and fitting-in is the be-all and end-all of all student life, anyway?

              "       \"Without an iota of irony, Charlize Theron finally uses her intimidating beauty for pure Machiavellian evil, and the results are fortuitous in this dark-hued 2011 comedy, the latest collaboration of director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody (Juno). She's absolutely spot-on terrific playing Mavis Gary, the condescending, hateful high school girl who comes back to Mercury, her podunk hometown nearly two decades later. Mavis is no Blanche Dubois-type character whose ladylike beauty has faded into a gauzy romantic delusion. No, Mavis is still one hot babe and very much the complete narcissist she was as a teenager, emotionally stunted despite her relative worldliness having moved to Minneapolis to become a ghostwriter of a series of teen novels.It's not surprising she finds success writing for an adolescent audience since she still defines her life with teenage-level priorities and fantasies. As she has proven withJuno, Cody is thoroughly fluent with this perspective, but the twist is that this time, it's coming from a jaded 37-year-old woman. Even though Mavis is a divorcee who lives in a high-rise apartment with a toy dog and can easily get any man she wants, she is triggered by a birth announcement email she receives from her high school sweetheart Buddy Slade and becomes fixated on getting him back all these years later. It doesn't matter that he's happily married and perfectly content living in Mercury. She concocts a scheme to make herself so alluring that he will want to run away with her. Normally, this would be an excuse for broad comedy machinations, but Theron is so gorgeous that it makes her shameless attempts at seduction look all the more edgily desperate.It's a narrowly developed plot for sure, but surprisingly, what enriches the proceedings is the unexpected relationship Mavis develops with Matt Freehauf, a sad-sack former classmate whose sole claim to notoriety was being the victim of a hate crime when he was beaten up and left for dead by a group of jocks who assumed he was gay. Now crippled physically and emotionally, he lives in Mercury with his sister making his own home-brewed bourbon and putting together mix-and-match action figures. That Mavis and Matt connect is all the more intriguing since they were at opposite ends of the social spectrum back in school, and their bond is fueled by her obvious alcoholism, a point that is overlooked by her befuddled parents who wish to think of Mavis as the flawless pretty daughter of their own deluded fantasies. The story evolves in the direction you would expect but not before certain revelations come to light in a tortuous scene at the baby-naming party Buddy and his sensible wife Beth have with all their relatives and close friends in attendance.Beyond Theron's fearless work and intentionally deadpan line delivery, there is comedian Patton Oswalt's surprisingly affecting performance as Matt. I only know him from his recurring role as a comical sad-sack on the sitcomKing of Queens, so it's surprising to see the amount of texture he brings to this role. As Buddy, Patrick Wilson once again plays the sought-after himbo, but this time, his character's unshaven, small-town modesty comes across as more contrite with his character's feelings toward Mavis left quite elliptical. Elizabeth Reaser (Sweet Land) isn't given that much to do as Beth, probably by intention, but Collette Wolf has a few impactful moments as Matt's insulated sister still idolizing Mavis after all these years. As he showed withJunoandUp in the Air, Reitman shows a deft hand with actors playing flawed characters who try to manipulate their circumstances but fall short of their vaunted expectations.\",\n",
              "       \"There's a line about a character from the movie Sin City that goes: He just had the rotten luck of being born in the wrong century.That sentiment somewhat applies to John Carter, in that while its effects are as modern as they come, the script feels like it grew from the 1980s, and I mean that as a compliment.  It was a fantastic time for action/adventure, sci-fi, and fantasy films. John Carter is impressive in its creation of a world, but it's also impressive in how deftly it avoids many annoying trappings of modern films of its like.  Sidekicks aren't annoying, there aren't any pop culture references, no wink at the camera nonsense.  It manages to not take itself too seriously, while also sticking wholly to its own world.Story in quick form:  a former Confederate soldier on a gold hunt ends up being transported to Mars, which contrary to popular belief is teeming with life--life that wants to kill other life.  Much as he wants to avoid war, Carter is swept up in one far, far from his home.That description does little justice to the movie.  War?  Not a fun subject, and often its the climactic charge! scene to many of today's sci-fi and fantasy movies.  John Carter keeps the pace strong throughout with good humor, amazing effects, and action scenes you can follow easily, from tower-hopping to airship-traversing sword fights to a little dog-monster that manages to be adorable while biting people's heads off.I fell in love with the movie because of the jumping most of all.  Because of the lower gravity on Mars and Carter's muscle density (or something), he's a lot stronger and more spry on Mars than he was on Earth.  He can leap all over the place and it's when he's doing this that the movie's magic comes to life.  Jumping between airships, jumping between towers, jumping from battle to battle--you want to be doing the same.The effects are amazing, the score is a classic--if I had to complain, I'd say there are a couple clunky lines and the beginning is a little messy, though it quickly straightens out.  What's stronger than all that is the heart of this movie, and I don't mean in the sappy family film sense.  I mean there's a heart of courage, strength, a sense of old school right and wrong that I normally don't get invested in, but here it was all so fun that I couldn't help enjoying it.  The movie really came together when you realize just how insidious the situation of the war is, and how important it is that John Carter is an outsider coming into this situation.  He's someone who can change it.Overall, don't come into this as cynically as I did.  The movie had to win me over, and it did, but it shouldn't have had to.  John Carter is about having a good time.

Leave aside the fact that Oswald almost flunked his Marine marksmanship tests and was a very poor shot, and the fact that Oswald never went to Mexico which Mark Lane has recently revealed in his new book, LAST WORD, and learn about Holland from Lane as well. Holland tries but fails as these films, particularly the Zapruder film, prove time and time again that the fatal shot that killed President Kennedy really DID come from the Grassy Knoll on the right and to the front of JFK's limousine.

I felt it relied way too much on drastic overuse of the f-word. Seriously, it was everywhere, and I am personally one of the word's biggest fans. But here, it was just too much.Paul Rudd plays this guy who really nice and sweet, and he's got these three sisters who are pretty self-absorbed, superior, and selfish. They look down on him, and on their mom, who is similiar to him (their dad must have really sucked). He gets into a bit of legal trouble, he gets dumped by his girlfriend, he goes to live with each sis in turns. He messes up! Big time! Oh no!You see where this is going, I hope. Because it's very VERY obvious. You'll probably be entertained for a little while, but this isn't the best movie you'll see all year. Rashida Jones and TJ Miller are in it, which is awesome, because TJ Miller is freaking awesome. He actually plays almost the exact same character that Paul Rudd is playing, and they are really sweet guys. Steve Coogan is also in it (but not nearly enough for my liking), playing Emily Mortimer's character's husband, with a fantastic line regarding her body.It's not a terrible movie, but it's not a great one.

Not only is this the worst film The Asylum has ever released, it's easily the worst disaster movie I've ever seen.  The storyline is laughably absurd, the acting is embarrassingly bad, and the special effects may as well have been done by a class of fifth-graders.  This movie is so bad that you can't even enjoy its mediocrity - rather than laugh at it, you just want to put it out of its misery.Remember how air traffic in Europe was brought to a standstill by the atmospheric effects of volcanic explosions in Iceland a while back?  Well, imagine what would happen if every volcano in Iceland erupted all at once.  Now stop imagining because you've already created a better movie in your head than what you're going to see in 2012: Ice Age.  Here, all those volcanic explosions send the mother of all glaciers hurtling down the eastern seaboard of North America.  Canada apparently offers no opposition because the glacier is bearing down on New England within about ten minutes (which is strange since we later learn the glacier is moving at a speed of 200 mph).  Patrick Labyorteaux plays (badly) Bill Hart, a big, doughy scientist of some sort who grabs his wife and incredibly wussy son and embarks on a desperate race to get out of Maine and get to his daughter in New York before the glacier destroys the Big Apple.  Most of the action takes place inside the vehicles the Harts employ on their journey to New York.  On many occasions, all kinds of CGI hell is taking place outside, sending their vehicle hurtling and sliding around dropping glacier chunks in a hurricane of snow and wind - but you wouldn't know it from the constantly steady interior shots.  Even more strangely, a number of exterior shots then show the vehicle traveling down a completely clear street, with the only signs of winter weather being some scraped-off snow on the sides of the road.  Of course, America isn't taking this new Ice Age lying down.  Basically declaring war on the glacier, the Air Force tries to bomb the hell out of the ice floe with jets - and, apparently in an effort to confuse the glacier, these jets are specially designed to magically morph between F-15s, F-16s, F/A-18 Hornets, and F-22 Raptors; some of them even become invisible, as the number of visible jets in formation constantly changes from one shot to the next.2012: Ice Age seemingly completes The Asylum's disastrous 2012 trilogy, following in the footsteps of 2012: Doomsday and 2012: Supernova, two movies almost as unwatchable and incompetently made as this one.  We can only hope that The Asylum will now get back to the business of giving us what we want: pop icons of the 1980s fighting giant reptiles and aquatic monsters.\",\n",
              "       \"No other character in the Marvel Universe is more suited to the manic, bipolar antics of Nicolas Cage than the Ghost Rider, which is why the 2007 film turned out to be so disappointing. Directed by Mark Steven Johnson with all the flair of dry toast, all of Ghost Rider's most unique genre attributes were frittered away in a bland attempt to follow in the phenomenal success of Batman Begins. With Johnson mostly out of the picture, the rapidly produced sequel gets a much needed fuel injection with the twin duo of Neveldine/Taylor behind the camera, bringing with them the same chaotic energy that led them to success with both Crank movies.Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is a more complicated beast, and for the most part Neveldine/Taylor are up to the challenge.  More in tune with the character's dark, pulpy roots, the supernatural grindhouse feel will be a welcome reminder to fans of Cage's underrated Drive Angry.  After a brilliant, Mignola-esque animated sequence zipping us through Johnny Blaze's deal with the devil that transformed him into the Ghost Rider, we learn he's been hiding out from civilization out in eastern Europe. His hopes of keeping the demon inside him locked away are quickly dashed with the arrival of Moreau(Idris Elba), a gun toting, hard drinking warrior monk who warns him of the Devil's(Ciaran Hinds) plan to attain a new host body. To do it, he'll enlist another damned soul named Carrigan(Johnny Whitworth) to kidnap the son of Nadya(Violante Placido), a woman he also struck an ill pact with. The Devil is a hell of salesman, apparently. He's always closing. The promise of eternal redemption is all Blaze needs to sign on for his most dangerous mission yet, playing the unfamiliar role of protector.With a trimmed down budget, this version of Ghost Rider has a tougher, meaner look to it. The lack of polish makes the flame-headed biker all the more visceral and terrifying, especially when he's got some poor thug in the grip of his soul destroying Penance Stare. The action scenes should be where the film really shines, but unfortunately the directors don't go far enough. While some of it is pretty awesome to behold, like when Ghost Rider jumps in a giant construction vehicle and lights it with hellfire, others are uninspiring.  Undoubtedly they've got a better grip on what makes the character tic, but you expect Neveldine/Taylor to go absolutely ape dump on a movie like this, and sometimes it feels like they held back.Essentially shot in exactly the same manner as Crank, it's when the Ghost Rider is on the open road that are the brightest spots. Sure it's a little dizzying with all the jump cuts, speed ramps and other crazy camera tricks the directors typically employ, but it works to give the film a distinctive look. Even during the rare times when the action slows down, there is rarely a dull moment. A self aware sense of humor, such as when Ghost Rider starts urinating hellfire, occasionally works but often feels a little forced.Cage gives the sort of performance you'd expect for a movie this insane. He's constantly on, flashing his teeth at every opportunity and always looking as if he's about to snap and jump off the cliff or something. While that may not work as often as he employs it, that's exactly the mode Cage needed to be in for this role. What's more entertaining is Idris Elba, who appears to be trying to match Cage for scene chewing honors. His chatty, wobbly Moreau is a total 180 from the strong and silent guardian he played in Thor.While it's not a great movie, fans of Ghost Rider will leave the theater far happier than they did five years ago. There's still a better film to be made, and perhaps it'll happen in a few years with a slightly better script. Ghost Rider isn't ready to ride off into the sunset just yet.\",\n",

              "       \"I'm ashamed to confess that, despite name recognition, I knew little about Phil Ochs before watching Kenneth Bowser's surprisingly comprehensive new documentary Phil Ochs: There But For Fortune.  Considering that Ochs died in 1975, there are still plenty of people around to readily share his story as well as his legacy.  And the documentary does an excellent job of balancing the story of the man with the story of his music--giving one of the most well rounded biographies that you might hope for.  A contemporary of Baez and Dylan, Ochs was decidedly more pointed and politicized in his lyrics and defied categorization as a typical folk singer.  From idealism, to a pursuit of fame, to an anger at the status quo, to utter despondency--Ochs' personal struggles often ran parallel to the times in which he lived.  His remarkable journey is highlighted in vivid, and uncompromising, detail and the film showcases a true artist whose impact and relevancy are still felt.Ochs truly saw song as a form of revolution and was inspired to write about contemporary news stories encompassing subjects as important as the Civil Rights movement and the Vietnam War.  The film interviews family members, music scene contemporaries, political activists, and many more in detailing how important Ochs was to the emerging and changing musical scene of the sixties.  These interviews are informative and enlightening and juxtaposed with plenty of archival footage that brings Ochs to the forefront.  And through it all, the soundtrack is filled with recordings and concert performances that show Ochs' talent to maximum affect.  In addition to the music and the contemporary interviews, Ochs' own words (through past interviews, etc) really make you understand the man--in all his glory and with all his foibles.  Seriously, this is a very intimate portrait--remarkable in that it is more than 35 years after his death.The film follows the real arc of Ochs' life, and consequently, it is not always a pleasant experience.  But it is a strong, powerful, and unexpectedly moving look at one man's pursuit of meaning in a confused world.  And despite Ochs' personal contradictions and demons, he did make a difference and influence a generation to social awareness.  It's a noteworthy story told well in a very solidly constructed film!  The film ends with a quote from Ochs' daughter which really encapsulates the surprising impact that this film had on me.  It's a pitch perfect note to cap off the legacy of a musical pioneer.  If you have any interest in Ochs, folk music, activism, the sixties, or just great documentaries--this is a strong and easy recommendation.  KGHarris, 6/11.\",\n",

So many reasonable, exciting, funny, ironic, satirical, scary and even MEDIOCRE things could have been done with that basic plot-line alone, but this Stew of Stool-Samples fails to even hit the level of mediocrity.The dialogue is ludicrously bad: it was clearly written by the kind of 21 year-old college graduates who emerge still utterly illiterate from their &#34;educational&#34; years, probably with degrees in Pole-Dancing or The Sociological Implications of XBox Character Motivation. Indeed, this ghastly piece of brain-sludge plays-out like a cheap video game from the early '90s, designed by bored Japanese gamers trying to approximate an American fairy tale after reading a synopsis translated from English into Sanskrit into Chinese into Japanese and then back into English.The action sequences are juvenile and just plain disconnected from any remotely purposeful trajectory.

As most fans of Spartacus know S:GOTA began life as a prequel to allow time for the late star Andy Whitfield to recover from the lymphoma that tragically took his life at the age of 39. On its own merit S:GOTA isn't quite as good as Spartacus but it is a diverting six episode series.The main flaw with this set is the packaging. Both DVDs had glue on the edge of the discs that were actually in the playing area. The discs slip into cardboard holders which also tend to scratch the discs as well. Considering the care of the design of this set I'm kind of surprised at the shoddy storage for the discs themselves.Focusing on Batiatus (John Hannah from The Mummy and The Mummy Returns) and his wife Lucretia (Lucy Lawless from Xena and Battlestar Galatica) two key characters from Spartacus who own slaves that fight in the games, the prequel follows their most promising gladiator Gannicus (Dustin Clare)who knocks down all opponents sometimes with just his fists. Batiatus wants to use Gannicus to expand his success. Gaia (Jaime Murray of Dexter)a long time friend of Lucretia's helps the rise of House Batiatus but at what cost?If you haven't seen the first season of Spartacus there are some spoilers that appear from the end of that show at the beginning of this prequel.The show looks quite good with a nice, sharp transfer of the highly stylized series.The special features include Starz Studios: Gods of the Arena a making-of featurette with cast and crew discussing the challenges and fun in shooting the show. It doesn't overstay its welcome clocking in a a brisk 14 minutes.Weapons of Mass Disruption runs just under 3 minutes and gives us background on the weapons used in the arena for the series.Battle Royale: Anatomy of a Scene takes us behind-the-scenes for one of the best sequences in the series and how it was created.On Set With Lucy Lawless runs under seven minutesas we get a tour of the set with Lawless.10 Easy Steps to Dismemberment is pretty self explanatory and clocks in at a brisk 2 minutes.Dressed to Kill focuses on the costuming for the show.Convention panel is an edited down featurette featuring the cast and crew during their Comicon 2010 appearance. We also get a blooper featurette.Post Production: The Final Execution and Enter the Arena: Production Design are the two final featurettes giving us insight into the challanges the team faces putting together the final product and how the look of the show was designed.Over all I enjoyed Spartacus: Gods of the Arena just be aware that it's 1) very bloody 2) full of sex scenes and nudity.

              "       \"JEWS AND BASEBALL: AN AMERICAN LOVE STORY is not only a documentary about Jews and baseball, it's about our national pastime generally, and how Jewish-Americans helped make it a sport for ALL Americans. Indeed, the music for Take Me Out To The Ballgame was written by a Jewish composer. The film briefly discusses Jewish baseball magnates like Bud Selig, Fred Wilpon, and others, but most of this documentary is concerned with on-field exploits.There has always been a certain low humor about Jews in sports. The film opens with a scene from the movie AIRPLANE, in which Julie Hagerty is handing a passenger 'light reading,' a leaflet on Great Jewish Sports Legends.A joke I remember from Hebrew School tells us that baseball is the first thing mentioned in the Bible: In the Big Inning God created the heaven and the earth. Exactly when and where God created baseball is not known, legends of Abner Doubleday and Cooperstown aside, but what is well known is that successive groups of immigrant fans and players adopted baseball as their sport and passport to Americanization.Jews were part of baseball from the very outset of league professional play. L. Emanuel Pike of the Philadelphia Athletics was on the first salaried team in 1871, and may have been the first great home run hitter of the sport, hitting six a year for three straight years during the Dead Ball Era.Between the 1870s and the 1930s, a workmanlike succession of  Jewish players followed Pike. Most were named Cohen and most used pseudonyms. It was not until the 1930s that a Jewish superstar emerged---Hammerin' Hank Greenberg of the Detroit Tigers who was to become the first Jewish player inducted into the Hall of Fame. Greenberg nearly matched Babe Ruth's and Lou Gehrig's hitting records; indeed, he may well have surpassed them but for the fact that Greenberg's career was interrupted by World War II. He had truncated 1940 and 1945 seasons and did not play at all in 1941, 1942, 1943, and 1944.  A focus of much verbal abuse by hayseed fans and players, Greenberg let his bat do most of his talking. He saw every hit he got as a swat at Hitler. But he never let his bat talk on Yom Kippur.Greenberg's career is the fulcrum of the film. Prior to Hank Greenberg, an athletic Jew was seen both as a person who perforce had to hide his identity in order to play, as well as being a freak of nature. After Greenberg, players named Al Rosen, Cal Abrams, Moe Berg and Sandy Koufax began to fill out Major League rosters.The Brooklyn Dodgers' signing of Jackie Robinson in 1947 is examined from a Jewish perspective by a rabbi who is also a rabid fan.The Dodgers' Sandy Koufax, the second Jewish Hall-of-Famer and possibly the greatest pitcher of all time, is portrayed as the spiritual successor to Greenberg and as the player whose career normatized the presence of Jewish players on the field. Those who have come after Koufax, like Shawn Green and Kevin Youkilis, still see themselves as representatives of the American Jewish community, but they are no longer subject, as Greenberg was, to ethnic abuse. Nor are they seen as oddities. Many fans are unaware that they are Jewish. They simply are talented Major Leaguers. And that is as it should be.The Extras focus almost exclusively on Sandy Koufax, a shy man who has been coaxed before the cameras for this DVD. There is also lounge singer Sophie Millman's jazzy rendition of Take Me Out To The Ballgame. Her silky voice is offset by some minor but noticeable lapses in timing. She sings like Koufax pitched as a rookie.A fun documentary, this is a must-have not just for those of us who are Jewish, but for all baseball fans.\",\n",
              "       \"Seconds Apart is one of those movies where the writing just isn't strong enough to make it a memorable film overall, however it does have a few really appealing qualities going for it.  For one the acting on the part of the twin brothers is excellent.  They're not quite as twisted and evil as I was expecting (which would have probably been a clich&eacute; by this point if they *had* been twisted and evil) but instead they're more like clever, often times likeable and normal teens with a darker edge to their personality.  Do not underestimate this subtle darker edge however- secretly these twins are capable of doing unthinkable things.The parents are also rather awesome, especially the mother who comes off so innocent, caring and normal only to suddenly do or say something totally unexpected.  I'm thinking of a hilarious line she says after she discovers Orlando Jones punched her son.  And yeah, the detective played by Orlando Jones is amazing in his role in trying to figure out how people die under mysterious conditions whenever the twins are around.  The twins have the power to possess people into killing themselves.Now here's where the problem lies- the story usually isn't particularly scary.  This is due to the twins not being very sinister when the moment calls for it, so the deaths that occur (a woman slicing her throat with a piece of glass and the most laughable one of all, a priests' leg arteries bursting as he screams and dies while pulling a worm out of his leg) are all very weak scares/deaths.  In fact the only shocking death is the game of Russian roulette played in the beginning where these teens can be seen blowing their brains out with a revolver.  Now THAT is a very shocking segment!Plus, despite Orlando Jones being a great believable actor, it never seems like there's ever enough suspense in the way he goes about his detective duties in cracking the case of the evil twins being responsible for the deaths.  Everything feels like it's bordering on making a mockery of the whole evil twin concept.  That's the impression I got at least.  It's obviously not a coincidence that so many people die whenever the twins are around, but more could have been done to make the story more interesting.  In fact maybe I'm crazy but the tone of the film overall reminds me of the Twilight Saga series (minus a couple really strong deaths of course).  I couldn't shake the Twilight Saga similarities in the way Seconds Apart's fantasy elements are presented and the style of characters which both make me instantly draw similarities to Twilight Saga.  Maybe I'm alone with that feeling.Also, often times the story jumps around awkwardly confusing the viewer in the process.  A dream Orlando Jones had earlier in the movie is an example.  I couldn't figure out what was going on for a couple minutes here.  Expect this type of awkwardness to pursue throughout the movie in small doses, but at least it's never overwhelming or a mess of confusion.  The story usually gets back on track.  Unfortunately if you add up all the little temporary confusing moments, it gets annoying over the course of the movie.Overall not one of the better horror movies out there but for 85 minutes of entertainment you could do a lot worse.  That's Seconds Apart.\",\n",

Like Shawshank Redemption, the protagonist undergoes physical, mental, and emotional damage that will either kill him or make him stronger although transformed. Like Titanic, a ship goes down and carries away family, safety, and security upon its descent. Like Lifeboat, an unusual mix of characters share tight, claustrophobic, treacherous quarters in a bid to survive at sea. Life of Pi is a beautiful story well-matched with breathtaking cinematography, visual effects, and sound design. Based upon the strength of these separate elements operating together in excellence, Ang Lee won Best Director.Truly fantastic is the powerful allegorical revelation of God in science based upon two interpretations of horrific, life-changing tragedies in the world of the protagonist a teenage boy. A storm at sea throws Pi either into the hands of God, or Mother Nature, or as Pi would have it--both. Driven to his physical, mental, and emotional limits while adrift for 227 days in the Pacific Ocean, Pi addresses the strains on his capacities by adapting to his horrific reality via spiritual, religious, scientific means, or perhaps cognitive dissonance.Some may view Pi's interpretations of his reality as opposite and therefore impossible. Others may view Pi's interpretations as complementary, and entirely reasonable. One step further and the viewer may even choose to accept the concept of God as the creator of all science and all scientific laws, God as the creator of evolution. Two steps further and the viewer may understand that logic and reason remain entirely compatible with religion and spiritualism. After two viewings, the only surprise that remains with Life of Pi is that it did not win the award for adapted screenplay.\",\n",

Produced in a matter of weeks and on a shoe-string budget, Revelations is essentially a place-holder produced by your good friends at The Weinstein Company in order to retain rights to the franchise while an inevitable remake rots in development Hell. Absolutely minimal thought and care were put into this film, as each and every frame oozes with idiocy and contempt for its audience.The plot, while admittedly less convoluted than the past four or so Hellraiser films, attempts to align itself with the original and in the process fails miserably. Two pseudo-rebellious teens head to Mexico to indulge in a bit of decadence but get more than they bargained for upon stumbling upon the mysterious and ubiquitous puzzle box. That thing just shows up anywhere, huh? When one of the buddies returns home, he brings home tales of macabre madness and a few cenobites on his tail as well. Can his family survive having their souls torn apart? Will Pinhead get what he wants? Is Tijuana really that dirty? Do you really care?Admittedly, the film may have been a bit easier to swallow had they hired actual actors to portray the characters on film. Make no mistake, the film is still ridiculous and embarrassing, but for the most part, it's amateur-hour here, with one actor inexplicably slipping in and out of a Scottish accent. It's a well-known fact that Doug Bradley, who stuck with the character of Pinhead throughout the thick and thin of eight films, was re-cast for the film, partially due to time/budget constraints, but more likely due to the actor having a spine and deciding that enough is enough. His presence is most certainly missed, though he probably couldn't have saved the film anyway. His replacement, whose name isn't even worth looking up, appears to be playing a parody of the character and has neither the screen-presence nor the chops to fill his predecessor's shoes.

Even sadder is that it makes a long-line of dim sequels look like masterpieces by comparison.

And to think that this $185 million production was held back from a late 2012 release to take advantage of Tatum's alleged star power and to give the movie an expensive $20 million 3D fix with additional shots, edits for more action - but even less clarity and coherence.\",\n",

Mike does a bad thing, and he too knows that, but somehow you can't hate him because of Giamatti's effective acting.Then a troubled teenager Kyle (Alex Shaffer) arrives. He is a grandson of Leo, and left his home in Ohio where his mother lives with her boyfriend. Kyle is also a talented wrestler, and joins Mike's team.

The film's wrap-up part looks abrupt and more Hollywoodized than the director's previous work about illegal immigrants.This is not to say Win Win is a disappointment. Far from that.

But this new version is a splatterfest!! Lionsgate certainly have done a better job than Newline did with it, the story continues immediately after the events of the original 1970s version which is great as it incorporates footage from the original during the open sequence then cuts straight into what happened next, you can forget about the awful original parts 2 and 3 as they have been completely disregarded which is for the best. The story cuts to years later as new events take place, the story is very good and well paced with a pretty decent cast to carry it, Leatherface looks brilliant and exactly similar to the original and the film is not shy of the red stuff, plenty of chainsaw action as Leatherface really take centre stage now as the lead villain, the gore is very good and it's the first time we see somebody really cut in half!! I really don't understand the negativity for this it could have been much worse is it had been another Michael bay production, there are a few discrepancies in the time line but nothing major people are just nitpicking, its certainly one of the best movie maniac films in a while and Leatherface is awesome, if you're a fan of good horror movies this is certainly a must see.

At stake for Belle (Danielle Harris) is the birth of her child in a hostile world.  At stake for Jebedia Loven (Michael Cerveris) is his fanatical faith, a position diametrically posed to the kind-hearted nun Sister (Kelly McGillis).  Everyone has something to lose in a world roiled by a vampire plague, where rapists, murderers, and human apathy are as much a threat as the blood-sucking hordes.And so Mister and Martin make their way, collecting vampire fangs as currency, with Mister teaching his apprentice how to effectively kill the monsters.  They work best as a pair, but Mister has his own personal code that causes him to immediately murder two rapists -- which will have serious repercussions later.What Stake Land does best is not focus on the vampires (basically, sun-fearing zombies), but on the ragtag family that forms around Mister and Martin.  As each survivor slowly succumbs to the cruel world, Mister begins to consider what his goals really are.  New Eden, a place that may or may not exist, comes to represent that future.  In a world chock full of vampires, when can a vampire hunter truly be at peace?Mister's evolution: as protector, as guardian, and finally as parent, leaves him with only one answer.  To Stake Land's credit, it doesn't give us neatly wrapped endings but instead leaves us with hope.

Sharpay Evans, campus queen bee and wealthy, pampered but lovable self-caricature, decides that she can conquer Broadway with minimal effort, but learns the value of hard work, good friends and consideration for others. Kind of a kid-friendly version of Legally Blonde, right down to the designer doggie.Her catalyst for this growth is smiling dagger-plunger stage star Amber Lee Adams (Cameron Goodman, playing it to the hilt in a film with a very, very high hilt), who calls our heroine Sharpie and basically tricks her into becoming her lapdog assistant. At one point, Sharpay even cleans a toilet! Omigosh!Amber Lee's character is the bad example of what Sharpay might become. But she's saved by the nicest young cute guy in New York City, Donald Hollinger (oh, sorry--wrong decade--that was Ann Marie's boyfriend).As budding filmmaker Peyton Everett, young actor Austin Butler gets some of the best lines in the movie. But unfortunately, since he's supposed to be the voice of reason and moral center, these lines make his character is a bit inconsistent and unintentionally funny.One minute he says to Sharpay, Everything you have to do will be worth it to have your dream, (the exact opposite of the film's message).Later he says, with gravitas, You've sold your soul just to get Boi in that show rather than trust in the dog that you raised. Even worse you've stopped trusting that your own talents would get you where you need to go!It's priceless stuff, but probably not as sidesplittingly funny as intended, though the production tries valiantly to balance camp with heart (a very difficult task).Here's another gem: upon making a dramatic exit, Peyton exclaims, One question--what happened to that hot pink whirlwind of confidence and ambition I saw through my lens that first day you got here? I mean, that girl knew she was special! That girl knew that she didn't have to do any of this to succeed! What happened to her, huh?Quite a few of the clever lines are appropriately assigned...Sharpay: Listen, Amber Lee Adams isn't what you think.Roger (Bradley Steven Perry): A self absorbed, two-faced panther who would eat her young live on a reality show rather than allow anyone to steal her spotlight?Sharpay: Okay, she's what you think.But ultimately, Peyton wins the match with this line he says--again in all seriousness--to Sharpay: There is not a marquee big enough, or lights bright enough, to contain the fame you're gonna have. You could just hear Dick Powell say this to Ruby Keeler in a Goldiggers movie. Which in this context, is probably fine and in keeping with the jaunty spirit of Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure.Production wise, the film is nicely shot and directed with skill by Michael Lembeck (director of Disney's Santa Clauses 2 & 3 and former leader of Kaptain Kool and the Kongs on TV's Krofft Supershow) and the city looks like the wonderland of That Girl.The Blu-Ray and DVD is sparse on bonus features, consisting mainly of a short doc about Sharpay's evolution, bloopers and footage from the camera Butler used throughout the film.\",\n",

It is a disturbing movie to watch, a film that was condemned by the Russian government, disallowing filming in Moscow - except for some undercover camera work for an apparent Coca-Cola commercial, and refusing to allow Russian actors to take part in the project.  It reveals the brutality of the Communist regime of the time, a period Russia would prefer to remain occultThe story is somewhat convoluted, a fact that makes it even more revealing of the nature of espionage work at the time.  Sergei Gregoriev (Emir Kusturica) passes secret documents to French spy Pierre Froment (Guillaume Canet) living in Moscow with his wife (Alexandra Maria Lara), documents so important that Froment must take extraordinary risks to pass them to the US Government.  In the US President Reagan (Fred Ward) must balance the importance of these documents with the balance of relationships with the French government under Franois Mitterrand (Philippe Magnan)  it is a tense struggle for power and at the crux of it is Froment and the ultimately captured Gregoriev who is tortured to reveal his French espionage contact.  The rush to finish at the end of the film is breathtaking and heartbreaking. There is a conversation between Froment and the US Feeney (Willem Dafoe) that places the soul of the Cold War years in perspective.Every aspect of this film is involving - the acting is first rate from everyone involved, the pacing is in the fashion edge of the seat direction, and the sharing of the innermost secrets of espionage is information we all should study.  A reenactment of the Reagan/Gorbachev era as well defined as any film has dared to show us.  Not only is this excellent filmmaking, but it is also information about a man's (Sergei Gregoriev) sacrifice that deserve honor.  Grady Harp, April 11\",\n",

Ben (Johnson) is a college graduate who majored in business and botany. Chon (Kitsch) is a veteran who returned from Afghanistan with the seeds that became an extremely potent form of marijuana and the foundation of their successful business. Ben contributes a great deal of his income to worthy causes and travels extensively. While he's away, O and Chon receive a video containing numerous severed heads and chainsaw. They fear Ben has been killed until he returns home a short time later. They had a scheduled meeting with the cartel and so, they go ahead with it. The cartel representatives propose that Ben and Chon join their organization, but rather than consider their offer, they say they take the time they've been given to consider it and make plans to flee the country. A DEA agent named Dennis (played by John Travolta) tells them that the partnership is the best option. They disagree but, before they can leave the country, O is kidnapped. Ben and Chon hear this directly from Elena Sanchez, the leader of the cartel who ordered it. Elena (played by Salma Hayek) tells the two men that she intends to hold O hostage until they honor the terms of their agreement.

That is what The Trip is about, at least the subtext--the sideways trip.Now that I have compared and contrasted these two films, I am required by law to rate them, so The Trip isn't as brilliant as Sideways, but it is brilliant in its own way. The Trip is actually culled from a television program, so you could say it is like a made-for-TV movie--but at least it was British television.  It actually seems more like a documentary, or even real life. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon play fictional versions of themselves that share some of the same curriculum vitae.Steve: Death is but a moment... Cowardice is a lifetime of affliction.The two actually began playing slightly fictionalized versions of themselves in Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story. That was about the difficulty of getting a literary work of Tristam Shandy's magnitude on film, but it showed the comic possibilities of pairing Coogan and Brydon. Brydon is exactly the kind of person that would drive a pompous egomaniac like Coogan bonkers. In Britain, he is actually better known than Coogan, but his success rests on a totally frivolous comedy bit where he impersonates the voice of a tiny man stuck in a box. That, and silly impersonations of Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Al Pacino, and Woody Allen. Steve Coogan's disdain for such frivolity is only equaled by his competitiveness and need to try and prove that he can do them better:Steve, Rob: Come, come, Mr. Bond, you derive as much pleasure from killing as I do.The dueling Michael Caine impersonations are kind of a running gag. Repeated ad infinitum, the sheer redundancy becomes the joke. It culminates in a visit to Bolton Abbey, an historical site that inspired Wordsworth to write The White Doe of Rylstone. When Brydan memorizes said verse, partly to intimidate Coogan, he is compelled to recite it in the voice of Ian McKellan, because he is from Bolton. Never mind that the Bolton Ian is from is a neighborhood near Manchester, with little or no connection to Bolton Abbey. This really sticks in Coogan's craw.I know on paper and in this review you might be thinking that this kind of humor is a trifle too dry for your taste, but it's funny. Trust me. Along with the laughs there are many insightful lessons about life and things that really matter.The Bottom Line is that The Trip is well worth taking.

Instead, the ethical questions raised will remain, like the walking dead, largely because, in an economic sense, the injustice which is at the heart of this film, adapted from Kazu Ishiguro's novel, The Remains of the Day, is very much in play today, where the fruits of life, enjoyed with obscene excess by many while so scarce for most, sets a reality of disparity and insensitivity which makes it seem more than plausible that we're headed for the same killing fiction which cages the film's characters.However you may classify this film after you have traveled through its frames, you will agree that the hallmarks of excellent film making--screenplay, casting, acting, direction, cinematography, design, were all integral to the journey, even if the destination leaves you cold, disappointed, and/or needing a warm hug.\",\n",

There are early inklings of promising emotional connection, particularly with regard to Magneto's backstory. A surprise reveal in a Nazi doctor's office provides a backdrop for some heart-string tugging. And yet the inclusion of the Holocaust as a plot device feels forced--somewhat cruel--as though the filmmakers were simply capitalizing on a notoriously dour event for their own gains, the gene-splicing backbone of the story notwithstanding. This forced sentiment continues through the first hour of the film in which a dream-team of mutants is discovered (or not discovered, in the case of one amusing and profane cameo that will be worth the price of admissions for long-term fans). The trouble is, these kids never really develop beyond their 'talents', and are given little do but sit around in a room blowing things up, breathing under water, etc. They are never fully developed as three-dimensional characters. In fact, none of the characters are very interesting, save Magneto (more on him in a moment). James McAvoy's Professor X is humorous and affable but occasionally obnoxious. Kevin Bacon is playing Kevin Bacon playing a super villain. January Jones is wasted as the diamond-sharp femme fatale. It-Girl of the moment Jennifer Lawrence shows little of the range that earned her an oscar nod in the depressing indie Winter's Bone. Ultimately, this is Michael Fassbender's movie, though he takes control of the film about 1/3 of the time. Nevertheless, his character arc provides the only interesting plot progression or emotional emphasis, though this is diffused by everyone pretty much knowing exactly how this movie is going to end, and what will become of Magneto in the future installments. There is still something intriguing about watching Fassbender hunt down Nazis in Argentina or invade Kevin Bacon's lair late in the film. He exudes careful malice, indicating an interior spiritual struggle lacking in the rest of the characters, despite their ostensible difficulty adapting to their powers (the Beast subplot, for instance, falls entirely flat as the actor playing the large-footed mutant never really rises above his pretty-boy exterior). It is worth mentioning that the last action sequence lacks total bite as well. Much like the Holocaust opening, the Cold War suspense feels reheated (this is a big ol' historical event in U.S. history so most audience members will know how it ends up, regardless of the mutants' hand in it). In the end, thirteen year old boys should really love this flick, as will anyone who has never seen a movie, read a text book, or delved into the X-Men universe. Everyone else will be mystified by the beautiful CG shots (though expected from a $160 million action film--they never rise to the level of jaw-dropping grace and brutality set forth by Vaughn's recent Kick Ass) and sharp-toothed editing (particularly early on). Anyone else will understand that someone read Robert McKee's plotting tips and fashioned a snapping script for people who would rather be jangled along through slick retro scenarios than to take the time to understand how any of these characters function on an emotional level. Perhaps if the film would have been recut as a Magneto-only story, it would have been much more intriguing and adult.

              "       \"CLASH (Bay Rong) doesn't try to revolutionize martial arts cinema. Restricted to chump change for its budget, it's got no business aspiring to the lush visual aesthetics of HERO or CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON. What it strives to do is to bring the martial arts flick back to the street level, back to its roots. CLASH doesn't engage in camouflaging quick cuts or deceitful CGI, and if there's any wire work done, it is sparse, brother. What we're left with is a lean and gritty, buttkicking Vietnamese action flick. I rate it a better than average 3.5 out of 5 stars.What drew me to CLASH more than anything is that it reunitesThe Rebelalums, Johnny Tri Nguyen and Veronica Ngo. They prove that their chemistry in THE REBEL wasn't a fluke. Veronica Ngo (a.k.a. Ngo Thanh Van) plays Trinh, the indentured enforcer of a mob boss nicknamed the Black Dragon. The Black Dragon had abducted Trinh's young daughter and now forces Trinh to carry out the acquisition of a highly coveted laptop which can unlock deep government secrets. Trinh outsources a crew of specialists, numbering among them the mysterious, unflappable Quan (Johnny Tri Nguyen).CLASH isn't as ambitious as THE REBEL. It's set on a smaller scale. And in its dramatic nuances and plot twists, it won't bowl over any viewer. Of course, not all of Trinh's teammates are on the up and up. Not everyone shares Trinh's motivations. No doubt, there's a bad apple in the bunch just raring to pull a heel turn. This is B-movie filmmaking 101. What distinguishes the movie are the lead actors. And the fight scenes. Johnny Tri Nguyen - who produced and co-wrote the story - deserves credit for attempting to instill heart in the screenplay, except that it's just the same old melodrama (although I did like the climactic five-way stand-off), and the pace is sometimes just off. Still, Nguyen and Veronica Ngo's performances liven things up. There's just enough complexity and emotional depth there that they salvage the storyline. Again, these two are good together. In some tangible way, CLASH acts as a love story between a tragic heroine and a burnt out but still smooth operator.It's in the action bits that Ngo and Nguyen truly register a vivid presence. The fight choreography is tremendous. I relished the joint fight scenes as the camera frenziedly tracks Ngo and Tri Nguyen as, in several set pieces, they work in concert to dish out punishment on one squad of goons after another. There's a frenziedness to the camera movement, but a clarity as well. The action is easy to follow.Just how intense is Veronica Ngo? When a thug smashes a beer bottle on the back of her skull, she merely gets irritated. Now, Ngo isn't about to rip the mantle of Most Badarse Female Martial Artist from Jeeja Yanin, but she demonstrates good moves. Johnny Tri Nguyen - who once did stunt work for the SPIDER-MAN film franchise and is a martial arts expert - may not be as explosive as, say, Tony Jaa, but, long-limbed and elegant, he exhibits a smooth flow. His kicks are fluid and whip fast and account for quite a number of his finishing moves. There's one electrifying bit where he leaps in the air and kicks three baddies. He also shows some decent ground work, executing some very nice grappling moves and joint-lock techniques. Naturally, CLASH, being a Vietnamese venture, features the traditional Vovinam discipline. But we also see bits of boxing, Muay Thai, aikido, and jujitsu, all these making for a satisfying eclectic mix. Heck, there's even a bout of tango, an endeavor which - according to Tri Nguyen in the DVD interview - is harder than martial arts.The DVD's bonus stuff:- A Conversation (in English) with Johnny Tri Nguyen and Veronica Ngo (00:10:34 minutes)- Anatomy of a Fight Scene - cast interviews and behind-the-scenes training clips, including the occasional inadvertent bruise and bloodied nose and a side-by-side comparison of a fight rehearsal with the actual film footage (00:05:52 minutes, with English sub-titles)- Cast of Characters - the actors talk about their roles (00:04:45 minutes, with English sub-titles)- Music Video: Tiec by Little Wings (00:05:13 minutes)- Original Trailer (English sub-titles available)\",\n",

              "       \"Weekend is a film that can be blatantly described as a Gay/ lesbian film. But the irony of handing it that title is that Weekend itself is a terrific analyzation of the boundaries often placed between the gay community and the straight community. In this film we follow two gay men who have just met: Russell (Tom Cullen): A life Guard who is still a tad insecure about his sexuality, and Glen (Chris New) an outed artist who plans to go to America to flee the boundaries that hold him back in England. The film follows the two over the course of one weekend, the majority spent in Russell's small apartment, where the two men learn about each other, have sex, and have fascinating conversations pertaining to the stigmas placed on homosexuals in a Straight world. It is somewhat clich&eacute; now to describe a film as having a documentary feel, but what other way is there to describe Weekend? Here is a film that is so intimate, so realistically acted and full of moments so private that it is impossible to look away. The performances are magnetic and unforgettable while the script is one of immense intelligence.At its core the film deals with homosexual issues yes, but does that mean it is only for gays and lesbians? Only if you're one of those people who also think Spike Lee films and Roots are only for black people. If anything this is a film that should be viewed more so by straight people. It is a superb document on the humanization of homosexuals. It shows us that we all are pining for the same existential things: Acceptance and love. Those two things might be wrapped in different looking packages between different people, but beneath the exterior the same kind of love is there. For that insightful revelation alone I would recommend Andrew Haigh's Weekend, but there is so much more to it. It is an exceptional film that follows in the footsteps of such great films as Before Sunrise. and like that film it haunts you for days afterward. One of the best films of 2011 no doubt.Pros: Very well acted, Great script, Kudos to putting John Grant in the Soundtrack.Cons: None\",\n",
              "       \"Over twenty five years after the fact and Maverick has become a drunk who makes hasty decisions under the influence, Goose has become a bit more reckless and still puts women before anything else, and Iceman's role has been reduced significantly as his smug arrogance is only felt in a handful of lines. What's that you say? Red Tails isn't the urban retelling of Top Gun? Well, you could have fooled me. It's not that it makes much difference though. No matter how you look at it, Red Tails doesn't really have much of anything to offer.At the peak of World War II, African American pilots are considered the lowest of the low. They're considered to be incapable of performing their tasks to their country to the fullest and are given leftover missions that don't even qualify as scraping the bottom of the barrel. The Tuskegee training program is no different as the entire squadron is mostly reduced to shooting down trucks, trains, and perhaps a cow every now and then. That is until Colonel A.J. Bullard (Terrence Howard) succeeds in letting the higher ups give his men a chance and they take full advantage of the opportunity.Red Tails feels really cheesy as soon as that quote is shown in the opening scene. The movie has a $58 million budget, but it certainly doesn't feel that way considering the opening credits. The amalgamation of planes ripping through the sky and tearing each other to pieces feels like a distraction or a cover up for the rest of your senses. Try to pay attention to the credits, how plain they are, and how cheap they look. That along with the score that feels like it was ripped straight out of a stereotypical action film from the 90s doesn't really seem like the type of tone they were going for here. The acting isn't much better as stiffness and monotony seem to be what they were aiming for. The Tuskegee airmen do begin to get a bit more comfortable in their roles as the movie progresses. David Oyelowo takes Lightning the furthest as far as Easy's (Nate Parker) squad goes, but they certainly seem their best in the face of tragedy. Terrence Howard has a few great moments, as well. Specifically his highest expectations scene he shares with Joe Lightning Little. But it isn't enough to save a second-rate film.The script is very dry. I don't mean dry humor I mean about as pleasant as trying to listen to somebody with a mouthful of saltine crackers. It feels so stale and again contributes to that 90s atmosphere I mentioned earlier. Keep an ear out for the Americans and how third grade they sound. The dialogue along with the monotonous tone spread out amongst every actor in the film makes everyone come off as a robot. These cows are armed, is a line that's actually used in the movie. There are a few lines that are almost decent. Winky's (Leslie Odom Jr) line where he says, Every time I close that canopy I feel like I'm closing the lid to my own coffin, is surprisingly good. It gives the momentary belief that things may turn around, but they never do. Smokey's (Ne-Yo) colored conversation at the bar is the most amusing thing Red Tails has to offer, as well. There are many lame attempts at humor that just make you groan. Black Jesus is perhaps the worst joke of all, considering how things turn out for Deke (Marcus T. Paulk).I was expecting Red Tails to at least offer a fair amount of eye candy, but the special effects weren't really all that impressive at all. There's a train explosion early on in the film that's been shown in nearly every trailer and TV spot. It's pretty much on the same scale as the train crash in Super 8, but it isn't nearly as spectacular. That's kind of weird considering Super 8 was $8 million dollars cheaper than Red Tails when it comes to its budget. What ruined it for me was that sloppy zoom-in effect that's relied on as a crutch the entire movie. The Tuskegee airmen will be in the midst of a heated air battle with the Germans. The camera would pan up to try and capture the action, but it would zoom-in (or out on a few occasions) nearly every time to try and show you who should be keeping track of. It just came off as sloppy camera work to me, as if they didn't have the proper camera placement for the scene and tried to adjust it accordingly. There are several things that don't really add up in the movie either. One of the main ones for me was that at one point, Easy tells everyone that there's no time to celebrate a completed mission and to return to base because they're low on fuel. But can you guess what they do in the very next scene? They showboat and celebrate. Not listening to your superiors and still getting praised for it is an overbearing theme in the movie, as well.George Lucas fought for 23 years to get this made, but after viewing it you'll more than likely be convinced that the man has grown senile over the years and that retirement from Hollywood is the best thing for him. The turnout for the screening was insane and you can bet that Red Tails will more than likely make a killing at the box office, but there's no way in hell it passes as a good or even decent piece of cinema. Amateur cinematography, a boring script, terrible acting, and the fate of certain characters being extremely predictable (you can guess Lightning's fate around the time things start getting serious with Sophia), Red Tails is the equivalent of a stand-up act that gets booed off the stage. It is just awful. I was left wishing the entire movie was just Cuba Gooding Jr lifting a pipe to his lips, pulling it away, and pretending to smoke the entire film. If it was just those clips strung together with no dialogue and that dubstep track from the TV spot in the background, I could have at least gotten a good laugh out of it.\",\n",
              "       \"Sebastian Gutierrez's ELEKTRA LUXX doesn't quite know what it wants to be.  It's a comedy, there's no doubt--there are some absolutely hilarious moments.  It's also an inspirational piece, and a character study, and a romance, and a study of aging and womanhood.  In these latter areas, it stumbles a bit, never reaching its full stride.The film revolves around retired porn star Elektra Luxx (Carla Gugino).  She's pregnant now and teaching a sex class for housewives, living a relatively quiet life.  One day, a woman (Marley Shelton) approaches her with a proposition: cheat with her boyfriend.  Shenanigans ensue, and Elektra slowly finds her place in life.  The film is framed/narrated/hosted by a porn blogger (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).The cast is solid.  Carla Gugino is phenomenal, carrying the entire weight of the film on her shoulders.  Gordon-Levitt is hilarious, as is Timothy Olyphant as perhaps the one guy whom Elektra can love.  Olyphant and Gugino's scenes are the funniest in the film; too bad he's only in it for the blink of an eye.  The supporting roles are also solid (a grossly underused Kathleen Quinnan being the standout), and there is a funny/creepy/thoughtful cameo from an uncredited great actress (no spoilers).  Perhaps the most surprising thing is that the film manages to be sexy without being at all exploitative; a true wonder these days.  On the other hand, the script is a bit haphazard; there are too many subplots that meander too far from Elektra's story.  And Gordon-Levitt's character is inconsequential; the actor himself is hilarious, but his skits (for that's what they amount to) add nothing to the story as a whole.  The overall effect is a film that tries to do too much.  It's still absolutely funny in spots (again, kudos to Olyphant), and gives Gugino a chance to prove just how good she is.  But as a whole, ELEKTRA LUXX feels more like a collection of parts that never truly congeal.\",\n",
              "       \"I laughed long and hard at prolific director Michael Winterbottom's improvisational faux documentary that purports to be a record of the road trip Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon take at the bequest of UK's esteemed newspaper THE OBSERVOR.  The assignment is to visit and report on a tour of some of the country's most respected, if remote, eateries.  When Steve Coogan first accepts the journalism job, he imagines it as a perfect getaway with his pretty girlfriend.  But at the last minute, she backs out and Coogan invites his best friend (and source of endless irritation) the happily married, new father, Rob Brydon.These two real friends -- yes, the two gifted actors and funnymen are actual rivals of a sort, as are all actors -- embark on a road trip that allows them to riff on all kinds of things from fame to fatherhood to food.  But it's the incredibly sublime impersonations that charge this slightly unhinged duo's increasingly intense arguments over -- of all things -- the proper vocalization of Michael Caine's inimitable and distinctive voice.  What makes it deliriously funny is both Coogan and Brydon will not let go of the one-upmanship or the criticism of the other's Caine impression.  The dissect changing vocal minutia during different aspects of Caine's career -- and then each man offers ever more hilariously accurate intonations of Caine's shifting tones and accents in various vintage and recent films.  There were moments when I could hardly catch my breath.  This is a smart, literate comedy.  I highly recommend tagging along with these guys  on this beautifully photographed, crazy, sweet and satisfyingly poignant road trip.\",\n",

I did feel as though I were witnessing something. There was a naturalness to the directing that made me feel as though I were there. Some commented on the extreme violence but to me, it wasn't until the last 90 seconds or so that I really felt uncomfortable. During much of it the violence was fairly run of the mill. The story itself was pedestrian. The bad guys come. They overact to make everyone frightened. But, of course, unexpected things happen and they need to adapt. Nothing really happens that you might not have already seen in other similar movies. The near escapes. The missteps by the hostages that , once failed, make the hostages plead for their lives.

Mythologized as extremely stagy and with rolling diction and round tones, (see SINGIN' IN THE RAIN for examples of this) there would be the occasional film from that era that does not fall into that trap.  True, there are performances in this film (Reginald Owen, O. P. Heggie) that do perpetuate the stereotype, but Herbert Marshall (in his U. S. debut) and especially Jeanne Eagels most assuredly do not.That Eagels was even nominated for Best Actress for this film was a small miracle, considering that she passed away between the time of the film's release and the Oscars announcement.  That she lost to Mary Pickford, that era's female superstar and married to Academy president Douglas Fairbanks at the time, is not surprising, considering all the campaigning she did with Academy members in private beforehand.  But to compare both performances, Eagels leaves Pickford in the dust, as does the film (COQUETTE is one of Pickford's worst films, hands down, and her win is one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in the history of the Academy), and that we now have Eagels' performance to watch whenever we want is one of the best movie moments of 2011.This is a full-out, ballsy performance that I can only compare to Heath Ledger in THE DARK KNIGHT (sadly, another performance that, posthumously in this case won an award).  Both are not afraid to portray a character that you cannot like and who have no remorse, but both Eagels and Ledger appear to have approached their roles without a net and just became the characters and the results are breathtaking, to say the least.  They come within a whisker of overdoing it but the passion of both sells what they are doing so that when it is over, your mouth is hanging open with wonder and you just cannot believe what you have just seen-it is that good.  It is like you have never seen that actor before and the character has just slapped you in the face.  You can also tell this was made before the Production Code was enforced-Eagels proudly proclaims that she still is in love with the man she killed, and that is where the film ends!  By 1940, the character had to pay for what she did, and with her life.This version was supposed to be included with the Bette Davis version when that came out on DVD a few years ago-it was so disappointing to see it left off.  Thank the movie gods that Warner Archive has finally made it available to us.  The image quality is a bit rough-they were working off the only existing 35mm nitrate print-but Eagels shines through.

It is the year 2079, and CIA agent Marion Snow (Pearce) is framed for the murder of another agent who was investigating stolen government secrets.  Snow is sentenced to 30 years in prison at MS One, a maximum security prison set on a floating space satellite where prisoners are kept in a cryogenic stasis.Before his sentence can be carried out, however, Snow is given a chance at a reprieve.  The prisoners have broken out aboard MS One and have taken several people hostage, including Emilie, the daughter of the President, who was on the satellite on a humanitarian mission investigating the well-being of the prisoners.  Snow is initially reluctant to take on the mission until he learns that Mace, the man he gave the briefcase containing information that could clear him, is aboard the prison as well.  More determined to find the case rather than rescue Emilie, Snow sneaks onto the vessel to find it overrun with the most dangerous prisoners on the planet, led by Alex, and his psychotic kill-crazy brother Hydell.The entire pretext for the prison breakout is incredibly flimsy...First the daughter of the President going into such a dangerous location with little more than a couple of Secret Service agents.  Then the whole idea of the warden unfreezing perhaps the most mentally unhinged prisoner out of some 500 total is ludicrous.  It would be like someone going to Corcoran Prison in California to check on prisoners and the warden wheels out Charlie Manson.  And of course one of the Secret Service agents are dumb enough to sneak a gun into the interview room even though they were supposed to check all weapons.  Now remember, this is supposed to be 67 years in the future...So what, they stopped using metal detectors and Backscatter X-ray machines in 2079 and now just take guys words that they are unarmed?  Right...I've been a fan of Guy Pearce ever since Ravenous and have always enjoyed his performances, but he seems to be trying to channel a combination of Snake Plisken from Escape from New York and John McClane from Die Hard with his performance.  He forces one bad one-liner after another and ends up being more of a parody of action heroes than an actual action hero.  Thankfully Pearce is bailed out by a solid supporting cast including Maggie Grace as Emilie, and Peter Stromare as Langral, the head of the Secret Service.The action in Lockout is wildly inconsistent.  On one hand the prison has an automated defense system of Death Star like gun turrets that are able to repel the aircraft of security forces that Langral sends in to re-take the prison.  On the other hand, Snow is able to escape at least a half dozen times from prisoners just by running through a door and closing it behind him.  Why is it he seems to be able to operate all the doors and the prisoners can't?  Lockout is a futuristic film but it didn't have the budget ($20 million) to truly pull off a futuristic look.  This unrated edition amps up the violence a little bit but this could still really pass for a PG-13 film.Ultimately, Lockout is a middle of the road actioner that provides a mild diversion but is completely forgettable.\",\n",

              "       \"It might surprise many people to find that many of our most revered adventure films hearken back to the era of the pulps for inspiration; the most glaring (and possibly best) example of that of course being the INDIANA JONES films. But there's also some brand-recognition that's at work at times to, more specifically with the recent (and amazingly awful) reboot of CONAN THE BARBARIAN. When director Andrew Stanton, director of two of the most beloved films in recent years (the beautiful FINDING NEMO and the Kubrick-with-a-heart genius of WALL-E, which I consider to be the best animated film ever made), decided to make his first jump into live-action films, he also looked back to the pulps. In this instance, he looked to the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs, the creator of Tarzan, and less-famously, the tale of a Confederate Civil War soldier thrust onto the Red Planet as originally told in the book The Princess of Mars. While the film itself surrounds the adventures of the titular character, the real star of JOHN CARTER is Stanton and the deftness and joy that he tells this tale which, aside from a few missteps and some less-than-stellar characterization, is a rousing pulp sci-fi adventure extravaganza with some of the most eye-poppingly amazing visuals of a film since AVATAR.This film has a cast that is to die for... aside from its star. You have Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris (The princess of the tale whose only other real claim to film is X-MEN ORIGINS: WOVERINE as Silverfox) who plays her as an intelligent, quirky, beautiful and deadly woman; Ciaran Hinds, James Purefoy and the voice of Polly Walker who all are there to bring the same charm or gravity that they brought to their respective characters in HBO's brilliant series ROME; Dominic West (best known from THE WIRE) as Sab Than, the would-be puppet tyrant of Barsoom; Mark Strong (the British heavy in just about every film from SHERLOCK HOLMES to GREEN LANTERN) as Matai Shang, the immortal who looks to control the fate of Barsoom; Bryan Cranston in an unrecognizable but important role; and the voice talents of Willem Dafoe (who also worked with Stanton on FINDING NEMO) as Tars Tarkas, Samantha Morton (MINORITY REPORT) as Sola, and Thomas Haden Church as Tal Hajus.Taylor Kitsch as Carter lacks a certain consistency in his characterization. He has charm and is ruggedly handsome, but he lacks the leading-man charisma a role like this requires. The writing by Stanton, Michael Chabon, and Mark Andrews, who have a number of characters to deal with, a great deal of plot and exposition and to combine all of this with some bravura action set-pieces hurts the film somewhat in terms of characterization and may seem like a waste of talent in some cases, but each actor has their moment to shine, no matter the size of the part. The real winner, cast-wise, is Collins, who is so strong in her performance that I want to see her in more roles, and would love to see a film based just around her character. But the film is strong enough on its other merits to maintain great interest in the characters and the story to see it all the way through and still have a terrific time.The biggest winner here is sadly the biggest loser of everyone involved here, and that is Andrew Stanton. He directs the film with an eye for spectacle, precision of detail, and most appropriately, a strong sense of fun; the best example of this is the scene in which Carter leaps from ship to ship eventually meeting and fighting alongside Dejah. It's an incredible moment in the film because of just how well each moment is orchestrated. He tells the story of the film with a visual assuredness that rivals that of more experienced live-action filmmakers, and the filmmakers assembled a fantasic crew of digital and practical effects artists so that the interaction between the human/humanoid actors and the CG characters is totally seamless. Unfortunately, the film was something of a colossal bust at the box office due to exceedingly luke-warm reviews, an epically poor marketing campaign, and the natural comparisons between this film and AVATAR. I would watch this film a hundred more times before I would ever even think of watching AVATAR again, but it's a comparison worth making. So because of all this, the failure of this film to reach the heights it was intended to hit is all on Stanton's shoulders, which may hurt his ability to continue making live-action films. Although, looking at the reviews on Amazon, this film might receive some new life on home video, and the disconnect that exists between the marketing of the film and getting audiences in the theaters may now start to dissipate via word of mouth.When all is said and done, JOHN CARTER is a exciting pulp-flavored visual feast with something for everyone, and I can only hope that everyone can watch it and enjoy it as much as I did.4/5 Stars.\",\n",

During the events of the first film, a plane taking off from Los Angeles ends up becoming the breeding ground for the same kind of rage/zombie virus for the crew and passengers alike, forcing them to land at a terminal and, you guessed it, get quarantined and race against the growing odds to survive.  What really makes Quarantine 2 so good is that it's surprisingly well-filmed, well-acted, and even more surprisingly taut and suspenseful as well.  Though it has its share of shortcomings, Quarantine 2 makes the most of its minimal budget and delivers the goods, which is something that many, many horror films of this type should take a big cue from.

              "       \"The Fast and the Fiveous is a high octane thrill ride that speeds along at a frantic pace, leaving plot and character in the dust. But that's ok, because all we care about is who wins the race. The movie gets into gear with the opening scene and never lets up. Sure, it's low quality. I know, the writing is bad and the characters' choices make no sense. And yes, watching Vin Diesel try to smile is a painful experience. But in the end, you'll find the whole thing stupidly entertaining.In fact, it was so stupid that my brain sort of shut off while I was watching and I'm having serious trouble coming up with anything useful to say. Did I already mention that Vin Diesel fights The Rock? Basically, if that sounds good to you, you're gonna love this movie. Otherwise, steer clear. But if you feel like reading on, be warned that my mind is not firing on all six cylinders. Five Fast Five Furious picks up where the last one left off (as if anyone's keeping track), with Dom (Vin Diesel) in jail. It takes all of 30 seconds for some stunt driving to flip the prison transport bus he's on, sending Dom twirling towards freedom--and man does it flip, over and over and over and over, until it comes to its final resting place. Boom: title screen. What an opening. Though there were only 6 people in the theater, it immediately filled with cheers. The movie must have anticipated my fear for all those poor prisoners' lives, for shortly after the title, we get a news report assuring us that no one was harmed. Dom and co. would never hurt an innocent prisoner.From there, we launch into a kickass train sequence with all sorts of fighting and stunts that would leave the main characters dead a dozen times over (I'm looking at you, 500 foot fall off a cliff). But who cares? It's awesome! That's sort of the theme of Fiveous in case you hadn't noticed. Unlike Source Code, which fails because it tries to be smart but is instead riddled with errors, this movie succeeds with flying colors. It tries to be dumb, so we watch it on its own terms, accepting everything that doesn't make sense.For example, the characters are totally weak and one-note. Doesn't matter how many cops Vin Diesel kills. He's not a bad guy. He just loves his sister and gets put in tough situations. We feel so much empathy for that dude. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) isn't just a cop who turned against the force and became a car-stealing criminal. No, he's a guy with a wife. How can you not feel for him? Especially when his wife is extra hot. She is, after all, the lovely Jordana Brewster. She doesn't do a whole lot, but not only does she have an amazing body, but also she's pregnant. Gotta care about her if she's got a baby in her belly. The characters make all sorts of irrational decisions and have no depth, but they're exactly good enough.The cops are even worse though. Dwayne Johnson's motivations are all over the place, and his sexy partner lets her lust for Vin Diesel's muscles get in the way of her job time and again. In another film, these might be problems, but in Five Furious, everything's already so ridiculous we just don't mind. Like I said, we get to see Vin Diesel fight The Rock. That's all I need, and it's probably the highlight of the movie. My friends and I kept shouting Ohhhh when someone would land a particularly devastating blow (which happened like every other punch). I'm pretty sure the other 3 members of the audience were as into it as we were.When people weren't fighting or smashing things, the movie did start drag, however, and not the race sort of drag. Every once in a while I'd catch myself actually listening to the dialogue, which was a big mistake, because I'd overhear things like this: There's a basically uncharacterized Hot Girl repairing part of a car or something. The also uncharacterized Asian Guy walks up and says: You really like doing that stuff, huh? Hot Girl thinks a normal response to that question might be something along the lines of: When your life is on the line--that's when you learn about yourself. Then Asian Guy says: That's a fair deal. Deal? What deal? Are these people even talking to each other? The exchange makes absolutely no sense, which apparently gets Hot Girl off, cause next she flashes this overly flirtatious look, followed by a cut away. What a beautiful scene. But heck, when the two of them hook up while driving at the end of the film (very dangerous. do not recommend), I was happy for them. Why not?Why not? I'm pretty sure that's what the screenwriter must've said whenever someone questioned one of his scenes. But it works! I mean, this is an action movie first and foremost. Whether or not it's a good film boils down to one thing: how much did it kick ass? The answer to that question, my friends, is A Lot. I mean, Dom literally rips a 20 ton bank vault out of a wall. Before this movie, if you'd ask me how many times I could be entertained by seeing a giant bank vault smash a cop car while being dragged along the street chained to two sleek racing vehicles, I'd probably have said four or five times. But now I  know the truth. It's dozens and dozens of times. Scores of times! Vault smash this car. Vault smash that car. Vault smash one car. Vault smash two cars. I think the movie actually states that the vault smashes every single cop car in all of Rio. A very impressive feat by anyone's standards, to be sure.There ya go. Fast Five is pretty awesome. Shut off your brain and turn on your, I dunno, eyes? If you go to this expecting B-grade entertainment, you'll have a great time. Fast Five does a surprisingly good job of keeping up the excitement at all times, and as long as you don't listen to the dialogue, there won't be a single dull moment.3.5/5 Was anyone else constantly afraid that Mia might have a miscarriage when she was jumping off of roofs and crashing through windows and flying around hairpin turns?Check out more reviews on thenickelscreen\",\n",
              "       \"The gleefully bad Lockout is determined to have a retro look and feel. The film aspires to be a politically incorrect and formulaic B-movie. There is no need to rack your brain over its plot holes. The simple story takes place in the future, when almost everything is dimly lit. While by no means a good film, Lockout is still somewhat entertaining.While investigating the conditions of a space prison (yes, a prison in space), the president's daughter Emilie (Maggie Grace) finds herself in the middle of a breakout. Officials send Snow (Guy Pearce), who is on his way to jail or worse after being framed for murder. At least one convict (Joseph Gilgun, clearly having a good time) is inexplicably obsessed with Emilie after spending a few minutes talking to her. Vincent Regan adds a little gravitas as the criminal ringleader Alex, but he, like the rest of these characters, is undeveloped.Predictably, Snow and Emilie clash. Snow is sarcastic and tough as nails, as well as disrespectful and whiny. He is not particularly likable, but he is funny and has an edge. In the face of certain death, Emilie finds it strangely necessary to try to get to know him. Her character doesn't make sense, but at least she shows a little gumption and compassion. (Grace's expressions are somewhat puzzling, though, since she looks as though she's trying not to laugh through most of the film. Or perhaps she's just unable to hide her attraction to Snow?)Snow treats her pretty roughly in the name of getting in and out, but their tension is one of the best things about the movie. Much of the acting is quite bad, including Peter Stormare's as the man who insists Snow's guilty. Lennie James is decent as a coworker supposedly on Snow's side, though he, along with everyone else, doesn't really seem to care about the potential deaths of hundreds. The end appears to be a half-baked afterthought, but a lot here is. Sitll, if you want to watch a movie late at night that doesn't take itself too seriously, Lockout isn't necessarily a bad choice.\",\n",
              "       \"MOTHER'S DAY starts out as a fairly well made, engrossing thriller, then about midway through the picture, it takes a nose-dive.  Violence and gore go way over the top and characters start behaving in very unbelievable ways.Apparently director Darren Lynn Bousman, who directed three of the Saw movies, was trying to appeal to that same audience, but the sad fact is that, with the talent involved here, a more moderate and realistic approach to the material might have appealed to a much broader group of viewers.The screenwriters seem to have borrowed elements from THE DESPERATE HOURS, RESERVOIR DOGS and KEY LARGO in this story about a trio of bank robbing brothers, escaping from a heist that went wrong, who take refuge in their family home, only to discover that their mother doesn't live there any longer.  Instead, they find it occupied by a couple, throwing a party for several friends, and they take them hostage.With one of the trio badly wounded from the robbery, they phone their mother, who arrives to take charge of the situation, which involves the terrorizing and torture of the eight hostages, all of whom have their own dark secrets revealed on this horrifying night.The cast is quite good, particularly Rebecca  De Mornay, who plays the maniacal mother, but even her fine performance dissipates as the movie's blood fest escalates.  It's too bad that these filmmakers have not heard that LESS IS MORE.The 2-disc DVD/Blu-Ray Combo Pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes audio commentary by the director and actor Shawn Ashmore.

And there's a noticeable lack of dignified old men like Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen.Yes, this is not the X-Men you're used to. X-Men: First Class goes back to the 1960s to tell the origin stories of both the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants, as well as their charismatic leaders Professor X and Magneto. The story itself is a puff piece used to introduce the characters, but the performances by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are absolutely spellbinding.In the 1960s, a CIA sting operation discovers that the the cruel Sebastien Shaw (Kevin Bacon) (who is working with the Russians) also has a small group of superpowered mutants who can teleport, read minds, and so on. And the existence of mutants is proven to the government by mind-reading telepath Charles Xavier (McAvoy) and his foster sister Raven (Jennifer Lawrence).With Shaw planning to spark off a nuclear war between Russia and the US, Xavier begins gathering his own group of mutants -- including Erik Lensherr, a Holocaust survivor who is hell-bent on killing Shaw. The mutants begin training themselves so they can use their abilities to the fullest, but they may not be a match for Shaw... and even worse, Erik might be.X-Men: First Class as a pretty fluffy main plot, since its main purpose is to bring Erik and Charles together as best buddies... only to have them splinter off in two very different directions. Yes, there's a lot of stuff about the Cuban missile crisis and impending nuclear doom, but it feels like it's just a backdrop for the REAL drama.But it is a pretty fun popcorn movie, though not as powerful as the first two X-Men movies. There are some very striking moments (the FLYING SUBMARINE! Epic!), and some pretty impressive action scenes. However, director Matthew Vaughn really underplays some important scenes (such as Beast's transformation), and he really beats you over the head with the gay parallels of the mutants (You didn't ask).As for the cast, the villains are pretty lackluster. Bacon gives a good performance, but he feels strangely out of place, as if he doesn't quite click into the story. And January Jones -- aka sparkly Christmas ornament with breasts -- gives a performance like garden tools scraping through a chalkboard. She is so annoying that she actually infects any scene she's in.But on the flipside, the protagonists are AMAZING. McAvoy and Fassbender are absolutely brilliant as two very similar men -- charismatic, intelligent, strong-willed -- who become fast friends, but are divided by their different views of human nature. Both actors really explore the bond between their characters, but you can see their differing beliefs slowly infecting it.As for the younger X-Men, they range from excellent (the adorable Nicholas Hoult) to horribly flat (Zo Kravitz), but the one that disappointed me the most was Lawrence as the young Mystique. She's not bad, but she doesn't show the conflicted feelings and pain that she needed to.X-Men: First Class has a rather lightweight plot and some sketchy casting, but is saved by the presence of McAvoy and Fassbender. A fun watch for fans of the X-Men.\",\n",

But the remarkable thing about this extraordinary love story is that without being prurient, the two men, and you, almost forget that they are gay and that they are brothers and they become simply, two people in love. The setting and people are beautiful, as is Brazil and Brazilians(go there sometime, it is very true). And the men live privileged lives in a sumptuous cocoon. The film starts out with the birth of the youngest, Thomas. He does not open his eyes for a month and when he does the first thing he looks into is his five year old brother Francisco's eyes.The two become inseparable, two sides of the same coin. They are so close that it raises the eyebrows of several adults including their mother who seems to know and accept what might come of an affection so intense. But they are still all innocence. The thing that seems abrupt is how they go instantly from children to adults disrobing for each other seemingly moments after their mother's funeral. But this too makes sense. For to portray any sexual tension between minors would of course be wrong and the filmmaker seems to be very wary of being needlessly salacious. They finally come to be separated and it is painful, but don't despair there is a touching and beautiful ending. One can easily fill in the blanks and see these men growing old together, only permanently separated by death.

But it's well crafted, well acted, and plain fun to watch.  'Midnight' is more reminiscent of his early classic period ('Play it Again Sam' thru 'Love and Death'), which had broader appeal than his later adult situation dromedys, and more laughs.Everything seems to hit here; his directing is tighter than it's been for a while, and the casting is superb.  No one could top Alison Pill's hilariously delightful portrayal of Zelda Fitzgerald.  If this isn't Zelda as she was, then it's how she should have been.  I don't know if Ms. Pill has enough screen time to merit Best Supporting Actor, but this performance will surely have producers calling.  She's already slated to appear in Woody's next film. (Unfortunately lead actor Owen Wilson's performance wanes in comparison, as he appears a bit out of his league, but given that is his character's role anyway it's not so detrimental to the film.)Finally, there is absolutely nothing offensive here, and if your teenagers aren't familiar with the Lost Generation, or slogged and suffered through 'The Great Gatsby', then this should kindle their interest as a fun way to learn of that era.\",\n",

What would you do?  When would you go?  Our imaginations are sparked, and thus, movies about time travel are often disappointing, because their reach never achieves what we'd imagine ourselves doing.LIMITLESS suffers from this as well.  Bradley Cooper plays an author with a serious case of writer's block.  He's smart, but messy and disorganized.  He's handsome but can't be bothered to take care of his appearance.  And he can't get going on the book he's supposed to write.  His girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) is finally tired of him and leaves.  But hope arrives in the form of a new drug that he is given by a distant acquaintance.  It will allow him to access 100% of his brain.  Suddenly he's got phenomenal cognitive abilities...particularly the ability to take random scraps of past things he's encountered and to put them together into patterns that no one else can recognize.  It's like the chess player who can envision every possible move and the outcomes of each of those moves.  Cooper finishes his book (and it's brilliant) and then sets about making some serious money with his new powers.With such incredible powers, he seems to strive to accomplish relatively little.  Yes, he wants to make money...that is certainly understandable and relatable.  But he doesn't see a big pattern for himself.  And as a viewer, I was constantly distracted by thinking...wow, if I had HIS abilities, I'd do so much more.  It felt a little bit like a failure of the imagination on the part of the filmmakers.  Thus, I felt vaguely disappointed in the film...a great idea that boiled down to a somewhat predictable corporate espionage kind of thing.Because Cooper discovers that this drug wasn't exactly developed with the approval of the FDA.  The side-effects, particularly of not taking the drug every day, are unpleasant.  And there are some unpleasant, even murderous folks who want the drug, or at least want the abilities that Cooper now has to work to their advantage.  Who can he trust?  How will he get away from all the folks who are now following him?  What will he do when his stock of pills runs out?It's all interesting but a bit generic.  Cooper makes a pretty good leading man here, but he generates little chemistry with the bland Abbie Cornish...so we are not terribly invested in their relationship.  Robert DeNiro is on hand to collect a paycheck as a big shot executive trying to pull of the most ambitious corporate merger in history...and he needs the talent Cooper brings to the table.The most amusing part of the movie is when Cooper has to borrow his initial stake in the stock market from a Russian loan shark, who inadvertently discovers the pill Cooper is taking.  Suddenly, this thuggish character becomes a LOT more dangerous to Cooper than the corporate big-shots.  This showed some creativity and the menace and humor of these scenes was welcome.I recommend LIMITLESS, but my admiration is not...well...limitless.  Cooper is good.  The basic concept is intriguing.  The action shenanigans are fairly tense, but feel lifted from hundreds of movies that came before.  I realize this is a lazy thing to say, but I'd say wait until it comes out on DVD.\",\n",

Herein lies the major problem: zombies = horror. If you're making a zombie movie it should have some scary things in it. The average horror fan expects this. While many aspects of the film work the bland presentation speaks to the motivation of capitalizing on a popular trend and emasculating it to the point you can get the youngsters in without parents complaining.The problems arise in trying to capitalize on a genre without really understanding it. In the theatre the final zombie confronting Brad Pitt was drawing derisive giggling. It was making facial expression similar to that of Ron Jeremy (those of you old enough to recognize the reference will understand the silliness) while making chattering noise similar to that of a dolphin laughing.Another problem was that the zombies were constantly falling. They were falling over edges, off roofs, over each other: no chance to send one sprawling was spared. A minor distraction comes in trying to anticipate what they're going to fall off next.The best way to get a feel for what you're up against in World War Z is to take 28 Days Later and drop it in a blender with Rise of the Planet of the Apes. One has to expect this, though, the film is rating PG-13 (which was probably their first mistake). A properly done zombie movie is not for the whole family. Hell, it's not for most adults.They make a nodding concession by having one of the soldiers say, You can put a few rounds in their chest to slow them down but the only thing that seems to work is to get them in the head. The problem is that they drop with shots to the chest. It seems the fear of ratings made the producers avoid explicitness you can find on primetime TV.What saves the film is the pacing. It moves along keeping attention easily by presenting believable characters and not becoming complacent.The best way to view this will be through Pay Per View. The cost in the theatre was ridiculous for what was delivered. If I decided to go for the home copy it will be a year or two after release when it's lowered to the more appropriate price tag of $10.00. Anything else would leave me feeling exploited for a second time.***Spoiler***Part of the problem with homogenizing a genre is breaking the rules that makes it work. Brad Pitt finds a solution to the problem (not a cure) in the idea that the undead are trying to spread the infection. What ever side of the zombie debate you fall on (fast or slow, smart or stupid) nobody has dared to take the scare out of them by suggesting you can just inoculate against drawing their interest.\",\n",
              "       \"There seems to be an endless and undeniable fascination with the cornfield as the setting for unspeakable terror. And the straw man has become something of an institution in creepy scares. I'm not sure when it happened or why, but these films now make up a sub-genre of the horror movie catalog. If you are looking for a presentation that brings a completely unique spin to the age old concept--Husk may not be your first choice in viewing entertainment. It is, however, a solidly constructed and surprisingly well acted entry in the field (the cornfield!). More concerned with establishing a malevolent mood, Husk works well enough as a suspense thriller which is sold by the actors involved. Note that I'm referencing it as a thriller, though, because this will not satisfy your bloodlust if you're looking for an all-out gore feast. Relatively mild in the splatter department, this works better as a character driven chiller.Initially, we meet a carload of five young and attractive vacationers. A couple of minutes of banter is quickly interrupted by a splattering of crows on the windshield causing the car to end up in a ditch. As the friends awake from the collision, one of them seems to have wandered off. Before you can say who's got a cell phone? (no one apparently), the group sets off with two of the remaining four crossing the cornfield to locate the ominous looking house in the distance. Havoc ensues as mysterious forces in the grain begin to stalk (corn stalk) the interlopers. Something is killing people and it's turning them into murderous scarecrows! My favorite part of this scenario is that once someone has been drafted into the undead league, they must go to the house to stitch up their own after-death costume. I've truly never seen zombie-like personages working a sewing machine, but what a practical way to make them earn their stripes!Through visions, we see the back story explaining the beginnings of these grisly happenings--but it adds little to the tale. It is the present, where each kid must face their own mortality, that is the primary selling point of Husk. The film is obviously well made, but its greatest asset is the cast. Very sincerely, they sell this hokum better than you have any right to expect and so the film does work on its own merits. C.J. Thomason and Wes Chatham, in particular, do well battling for the alpha male position. Both bring a pleasing intensity that actually drew me in. I loved the finale, as well. This brief eighty minute sojourn into the cornfield isn't revolutionary new horror, but it is certainly not without its pleasures. About 3 1/2 stars for me--I think the film accomplishes its goals--and I fully expect to see some of the actors graduate to bigger projects. KGHarris, 2/11.\",\n",
              "       \"Gettysburg and Gods and Generals both have strengths and weaknesses.Gettysburg is a mostly good movie with the sort of epic scope we thought we would never see again after the death of David Lean.  It's the kind of movie we thought Hollywood had forgotten how to make.  It's also rousing.  Is there a boy reared in the south who did not sit in the theater actually believing this time Pickett's charge would break through?One weakness of the movie is Martin Sheen's miserable performance as Robert E. Lee.  The novel's author Michael Shaara describes Lee as under the weather during the battle.  May be.  Sheen's Lee seems to be suffering from Alzheimer's.  He's waffling, indecisive, ineffective, far from the commander Lee actually was.  And he was not suffering from mental problems.  After the war he went on to Washington College (now Washington and Lee) and was one of the chief figures in healing the rejoined United States after the war.  Southern accents are difficult in the best of times for non-southerners (the Brits do it best).  Sheen, from Ohio, hasn't a clue.  His performance nearly kills an otherwise good movie and I cannot watch Gettysburg again because of it.Another flaw is that Michael Shaara's novel, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1975, was based on the best scholarship on the battle available at the time.  Since then, new scholarship has revised our understanding of strategic decisions made by the participants.  These new ideas probably should have been incorporated into the film.  Since when has Hollywood cared about fidelity to a novel, anyway?Gettysburg also leans too heavily in favor of Longstreet who, more than anyone, is a central player in this game.  That bit of historical revisionism did make it in the film but I suppose everyone is entitled to their opinions.The otherwise fine cast pulls the movie through to the finish line, particularly Jeff Daniels as the Yank Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, and the Reb General Lewis Armistead (Richard Jordan, very affecting in his final film role;  every actor who was once a star should have such an exit).Gods and Generals has almost diametrically opposed strengths and weaknesses.  One thing is does right is cast Robert Duvall as Robert E. Lee.  Duvall's Lee is the heart of this film. And a game cast does its best playing soldier.  What God lacks that Gettysburg had is focus.  It tries to do too much with one movie, following the war from just after the outbreak of hostilities when Lee was offered command of the defense of Washington (April 18, 1861) until the death of Stonewall Jackson at Chancellorsville -- just a few months before Gettysburg.  That's a lot of information for one movie.I had hoped the extended version of Gods would keep the movie from feeling so jumpy and forced, but it only adds more boring stuff to what's there already.In both movies, keep an eye peeled for James Patrick Stuart from Andy Richter Controls the Universe as artillery commander and post-war scribe Porter Alexander;  and in Gods watch for William Sanderson -- Larry, brother of Darryl in Newhart -- as Confederate General A. P. Hill.A third installment, about the end of the war, was planned, but it was shelved when Gods tanked at the box office.  It's just as well.\",\n",

              "       \"MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL is a perfect popcorn summer movie, never mind that it's coming out in wintertime. It doesn't try to be more than what it is. It harbors no pretense to high-minded Merchant Ivory ideals. It merely wants to entertain the bejesus out of you with a barrage of fun explosive espionage. All it asks is a suspension of disbelief and, since this is Christmas time, accomodating them folks at Bad Robot isn't so far a stretch. This franchise has always been hugely entertaining if you're into crazy cloak and dagger and action sequences contrived with audacity and flair. The stunt crew wore their big boy pants for this one.What mission is so crucial that it requires a languishing Ethan Hunt to be sprung from a Russian gulag? This time out the McGuffin centers around Russian nuclear launch codes and the nuclear extremist codenamed Cobalt who seeks to make use of them. Ethan, still recovering from his wife's death, is saddled with a new crew. It comprises vengeful-minded operative Jane Carter (Paula Patton, drop-dead gorgeous), new field agent and resident tech-head Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg, very funny), and seemingly out-of-his-depth IMF (Impossible Missions Force) chief analyst Brandt (Jeremy Renner). It turns out this team doesn't play too well with each other. When the caper in Moscow goes disastrously south - and exploded bits of the Kremlin would attest to how rough it all went - the U.S. President initiates Ghost Protocol which mandates the disavowal of the IMF. Short on support and resources, Ethan Hunt has no recourse but to put on a hoodie and regroup with his newly declared rogue operatives.Brad Bird, who helmed IRON GIANT and THE INCREDIBLES, transitions to live action directing and makes it look easy. Of course, it helps when you have an icon like Tom Cruise headlining the project, but, really, nothing about the production values look cheap. The film makes use of exotic locales as what's left of IMF travels from Budapest to Russia to Dubai to Mumbai. The spy gadgets are cool - the blink-activated eye lens camera, the edifice-scaling suction gloves, the magnetic flotation device, etc. - even if they all almost universally end up betraying their operators. But that's part of the fun. It would be horrid if these spy strategies work seamlessly.I would've loved to have seen more of Paula Patton in action because she seems to have the physicality to sell Jane Carter as a buttkicking spy. But her much anticipated showdown with the female assassin is a bust. Meanwhile, Simon Pegg can show up on anything and I'll watch it. He's awesome; he never fails to add comedic color. Jeremy Renner does exhibit several wicked good moves in various confrontations. Word on the street is that whenever Cruise decides to step down, Renner's set to fill in those shoes. It should be fine, providing you take into consideration that Renner doesn't carry a smidge of Cruise's star wattage.Tom Cruise has mastered the blueprint for playing that relentless, undaunted super-spook. And you have to respect the shape he's in and his nerves of steel because there's no way in the world would I have scaled the outside of the Burj Khalifa tower, only, like, the tallest building in the world (there's some silly plot point about having to access the tower's server room on the 130th floor from the exterior). Cruise performs this stunt himself, and somewhere maybe his stunt double is wiping his sweaty brow in relief. These action set pieces are spectacular stuff. And because it's dull when the super spy is too indomitable, I like the running gag which centers on Ethan Hunt's jumping misadventures; all his desperate leaps end up with his just missing the mark. It's nice to see a chink in his armor. But, holy carp, this guy's pain threshold must be unbelievable. Ethan Hunt takes a hellacious beating in this film that I don't think even wearing a fresh stylish leather hoodie can make up for.\",\n",

I give Anchor Bay credit for releasing some of the better horror I've seen in the past few years.

              "       \"I find the footage of 42nd street in all its dangerous and lurid detail really appeals to my sense of long gone seedy N.Y.C aestheticism, a neon labyrinth of temptation and vice. Lead actor Baird Stafford recants his photographic memory for this production on his commentary track that shooting these scenes after dark was asking for a mugging Thankfully the camera sticking out of the car following him allowed his safe passage.Stafford is the star here, in a performance so committed that it transcends the regular suspension of disbelief required for general film viewing and not least in horror cinema. Unlike in the similarly comparable film: Maniac where titular actor Joe Spinell breaks his believability of playing a disturbed psychopath to enact dialogue scenes with Caroline Munro, so the film could gain financial completion, in Nightmare Baird Stafford remains true to his character. When we see George Tatum foaming at the mouth and the effluvia running into his nose and eyes as he writhes and contorts his body in seizure is one of many seemingly convincing portraits of physical and emotional psychosis.What sets this apart from so many slasher / gore movies of this period is the fusion of graphic sexual suggestion and gore, I can't think of another picture I've seen quite like this one. The special effects makeup may not be the most convincing ever put on screen, although they look suitably horrible enough for this viewer, but the inclusion of child actors involved is genuinely disturbing and some may argue morally dubious, but hey it's only a movie. The child playing the disturbed George as a boy is another credible performance and if you listen to the commentary track you will hear how the boy's mother on seeing her son emerge from the shooting of the recurrent Nightmare was that of being horrified.Here in Blighty this film is widely known by fans as being one of the most notorious video nasties on the banned list, not least in part due to the fact that the UK distributor was jailed here for six months, not surprisingly then that the movie is unlikely to ever get released here in this the full and uncut edition.As an older viewer returning to this film after many years I can see now that Nightmare does steal from Italy's grandfather of horror cinema Mario Bava. Anyone familiar with the reveal shot in: Shock 1977 used twice in Nightmare and the bouncing white ball signifying madness in: Kill Baby, Kill 1966, but if you're going to steal then stealing from a master is the way to go.Special mention must go to this film's score which perfectly complements the theme of mental psychosis. This synthesizer based composition sounds something like trapped birds crying, very creepy and one of the more original early 1980's horror scores.\",\n",

              "       \"Like all self-respecting disaster movies, Arctic Blast starts out with a narrator giving us some scientific facts that will prove quite relevant for all that is to follow.  The coldest place on Earth, we are told, is not the North or South Pole but the Mesosphere (some fifty to a hundred kilometers above sea level), where the temperature is well under a hundred degrees below zero (Fahrenheit).  After this brief introduction, though, the science of Arctic Blast quickly changes into something the writers came up with in their imagination (much like the pseudo-science of global warming).  For reasons no one ever even attempted to explain, a full solar eclipse somehow causes a rift in the ozone layer that quickly becomes a really big hole in the ozone.  Now maybe you're thinking such a hole in the ozone is going to cause temperatures to increase and result in all kinds of nasty consequences from an overabundance of ultraviolet rays rushing down to the Earth's surface.  Sorry - but you're quite wrong.  What actually happens is that the hole in the ozone layer allows the freezing temperatures in the higher Mesosphere to come pouring down to Earth through the hole, resulting in an ever-expanding wave of deadly cold frost and fog.  We're talking really, really cold here - cold enough to flash freeze every human (and virtually everything else) it comes in contact with.It's obvious what such a dire situation calls for: a rogue-ish scientist having a serious relationship problem with a wife or girlfriend brought on by his over commitment to his job and under commitment to his family.  Luckily, we have just such a guy down in southern Australia, only a few hundred miles from the location of the rift.  Not only is Jack Tate (Michael Shanks) dealing with a wife asking for a divorce and an alienated daughter, he also has a boss who doesn't want to hear his ideas despite the fact he's the best man in his field.  Clearly, Jack Tate is the man for the job.  He is the first person to understand what is happening, but no one believes his warnings of a killer cold front coming straight for Australia - not until flash-frozen human popsicles start littering the island of Tasmania.  Does his boss listen to him then?  Of course not.  He cuts Jack completely out of the loop and comes up with his own cockamamie scheme for repairing the damage to the ozone layer.  Meanwhile, more rifts start popping up all over the globe, taking on more and more of the appearance of a mass extinction event.Really, this is a great idea for a low-budget disaster movie.  Heck, all you really need are some great big smoke and fog machines, and you've got most of your special effects right there on the cheap.  Add in a makeup artist to make a few people look frozen, sprinkle a little CGI on top (it's not a disaster movie without at least one explosion), and you're done.  Fortunately, the film also has the good sense to limit its we caused this with our pollution propaganda to a bare minimum, making it easier to enjoy.  The end result is an exceedingly average disaster flick - an unremarkable yet filling serving in my steady diet of low-budget disaster movies.\",\n",
              "       \"Over-the-top supposed horror-comedy that tries to make up for its lack of good material by throwing lots of 3-yr old level toilet humor at the viewer in the hopes that he won't notice that there is very little here.  The various installments (shown as fictional drive-in features) have their moments, but each of them, about 20 minutes long apiece, go on about 15 minutes too long, like a good joke that goes stale fast.  As a child, I loved watching the old Adam West Batman show, but when I saw it again as an adult, I quickly became annoyed at its unsubtle, in-your-face campiness.  This movie reminds me of that experience, with its initial shock-value wearing off far too quickly, while oblivious film-makers carry on laboring under the delusion that what they are doing is comedic when, in actuality, it devolved into obnoxiousness long ago.  The best one, I thought, was the B@W Diary of Anne Frankenstein, with its mixture of truly bad taste and Hogan's Hero-esque humor.  The '60-ish film look in the initial Wadzilla feature was well done (better than the actual story).  The cast did a good job, so don't blame them, they aren't script-writers or directors.

              "       \"Even in unfortunate situations like the recent scandals that have rocked Wall Street, and affected the future of millions of investors, there are opportunities to create humor.  Created by Michael Patrick King and Whitney Cummings, CBS's 2 Broke Girls, is a comedy set in New York City featuring two women from completely different ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, who come together as coworkers, only because one has lost her fortune, due to her father's involvement in a financial scandal.  This is a well-cast show with pretty good writing, but it is often a little too crude than it needs to be, with frequent references to sex, drugs, and crime.The series stars Kat Demmings as Max Black, a waitress in a small restaurant in Brooklyn.  She's street smart, a little hardened and cynical, and has a bit of a gutter mouth, but underneath that rough and crude exterior, there's a warm caring person.  Beth Behrs is Caroline Channing, a slim blonde beauty who bears more than a passing resemblance to Paris Hilton.  Caroline's father Martin was convicted and sent to prison for his involvement in a financial scandal (think Bernie Madoff).  In the process, the Channing family's financial assets were frozen, leaving Caroline locked out of her luxury apartment, and denied access to her rather substantial trust fund.The setup for the series is established in the first episode, as a desperate Caroline becomes a waitress at the Williamsburg Diner.  Owner Han Lee (Matthew Moy) hires Caroline, teaming her with Max, who is less than enthusiastic with being saddled with someone with zero experience.  Also in the restaurant are Oleg (Jonathan Kite) a cook who sexually harasses the girls, and Earl (Garrett Morris, the venerable SNLer) the lovable cashier.  With no place to live, Max invites Caroline to stay in the apartment that she currently shares with her boyfriend, but after catching him with another woman, Max kicks him out, and Caroline becomes her new roommate.Much of the humor is based on the obvious and pronounced differences between the two girls.  The contrast between the women's attitudes extends far beyond just economic matters, and provides many comic opportunities for the writers.  The writing is generally sharp edged, creative, and pretty clever, although presumably to appeal to a younger audience, heavily infused with vulgarity.  The sexual innuendo is frequently at the gutter level, when it really doesn't need to be.Both lead actresses are well cast, and do a nice job of immersing themselves into their characters.  Kat Demmings (Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist, Thor) brings to Max, a realistic working class toughness, surly attitude, a body loaded with ample curves, and often delivers her lines with a cynical scowl.  Behrs has good comic instincts, to go along with a model's figure, and the stereotypical airhead chick voice she employs.  Caroline is a cartoonish character, who sometimes seems semi-detached from reality.  A graduate of Wharton business school, Caroline is particularly bright when it comes to financial matters, and applying her academic rich girl sensibilities to real world situations, is one of the foundations of the program's humor.While the differences between the Caroline and Max establishes a baseline, it is the things that they share in common, and the mutual experiences that bond them together, that makes the show interesting, and gives it some warmth as their friendship grows.  One common interest they share early on, is Caroline's horse Chestnut, who is kept in the backyard of Max's apartment.  The big thing though is their business partnership, as the ladies plan to make a successful business from Max's talent for baking cupcakes.  At the close of each episode, the running total of their financial assets is updated.The characters Han, Oleg, and Earl, are a bit racially stereotyped, and as the season progresses only Oleg really assumes a more significant role.  To perk things up, late in the season the writers introduce Sofi Kachinsky (Jennifer Coolidge), a mysterious woman who lives upstairs in the same building as the girls.  Another ethnically influenced character, Sofi is from Eastern Europe and runs a cleaning service.  Sofi becoming romantically involved with Oleg, provides another bridge between the girl's private life, and the things that happen at work.  The voluptuous Jennifer Coolidge (ExTerminators) is an experienced actress, whose presence strengthens the program, while creating more opportunities for the writers.With a talented and funny cast, 2 Broke Girls is clearly a series with much potential, however the writing exhibits a fixation with profanity, sexual innuendo, and double entendre, that seems to increase as the season progresses.  Even if an increase in vulgarity contributes to the program's popularity, CBS isn't a cable network, and not sinking into the gutter too often, may in the long run, result in the show reaching a larger audience.  The hilarious season finale, which features a guest appearance by Martha Stewart, is absolutely fabulous, and demonstrates that a little more class, and a little less crass, might be a winning approach for this very entertaining program.\",\n",

If there is any doubt that Ronald Reagan wasn't a good film actor, those can be put to rest in this film as he turned in a very fine and sensitive performance.  In fact, I have seen several of his films and his performances are at least as good if not better than half the existing Hollywood Actors of today.This movie contains a real atmospheric setting off the coast of Florida and the grand old house where the story unfolds is just perfectly suited to support the story.

This film is crisply edited and the story is riveting. I love the way Hensleigh incorporates vintage newsreel footage into the narrative.  Hensleigh has assembled a top-notch cast in support of what should be a star-making turn by Ray Stevenson.  Stevenson's Danny Greene is as complex a character as you'll find in any film, an ambitious yet ultimately self-destructive powder keg of a man who somehow manages to squirm out of a series of predicaments of his own device.

If it is, then England is a whole lot more different from America than I thought it was. But even if Weekend is accurate in that respect, it undermines the otherwise wonderful story this movie tells, and tells more beautifully and more realistically than any other movie I know of.To me, it's a shame, because the always-in-your-face drug use leaches focus off the two guys onto a side issue that is not really as important in their relationship as its percentage of screen time would indicate. I don't care about drugs one way or another, but I do care about movies, and the heavy drug use in this movie undermines its power by distracting the viewer's attention away from the characters.

If you get an opportunity, do yourself a favor and dust off this old chestnut.James Mason pretty much classes up whatever joint he steps into. He plays Alan Thurston, a fugitive British agent caught in a desperate race against German operatives. His mission is to unearth a roll of film which reveals the secret location of the planned Allied invasion of North Africa. Carla Lehmann is marvelous as Susan Ann Foster, the plucky and resourceful American girl (visiting from Kansas) who abets Thurston (and naturally falls in love with him). CANDLELIGHT IN ALGERIA is mostly framed as a flashback story and told from the girl's perspective. The film's opening moments present a scene in which the Allied soldiers are triumphantly marching thru the Algerian streets and, in a nearby hospice, a recuperating Susan Foster wonders if the gallant British agent had survived his mission. At which point, roll the flashback...What makes James Mason so watchable is that you could sense some sort of turmoil stirring beneath the calm facade. No one can do buttoned-down melancholy quite like Mr. Mason. In a way, it's a refreshing change of pace that, for this flick, he rolls with a more heroic, more dapper sensibility. Mason is practically breezy in this role. He displays a wry affability and a keen sense of humor, and I loved the witty banter exchanged between him and Carla Lehmann. Their first encounter, as Lehmann initially demurs from helping Mason, and Mason airily tells her (as only Mason could deliver it): Okay, Kansas, pull your chin in. No one's going to shoot you. That's when I knew I was in good hands, and was in for a good time.I love these old school WWII spy thrillers, and if they're British, then all the better. You can't beat stuff like THE THIRTY NINE STEPS, THE LADY VANISHES, PIMPERNEL SMITH, and FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO (this last one may not be British-made). CANDLELIGHT IN ALGERIA is gripping and presents an exotic flavor, taking place as it does in Algiers. Place like that, fraught with that pensive wartime atmosphere, one almost can't help but engage in international intrigue and close shaves and desperate romance. James Mason has never been more cool or stiff-upper-lipped than when he's playing taut cat & mouse games with the Nazis' chillingly perceptive chief investigator Dr. Muller (a menacing Walter Rilla). Who knew James Mason could be so at ease flirting with danger in the casbah. Running at a well-paced 81 minutes, CANDLELIGHT IN ALGERIA is an all-around intelligent and classy production, never mind that James Mason for a while insists on wearing that ridiculous fez.\",\n",

Peyton, in which the old world of the early 20th century is pitted against the new.The plucky Christina, an orphan, finds herself at Flambards, the crumbling estate of her crippled uncle still clinging to the remnants of the 19th century notion of noblesse oblige.  This definition of noblesse is not what Christina expects.  She finds herself attached to her sensitive cousin Will, a disabled young man with aspirations to fly aeroplanes, and she finds herself repelled by his brother, the brutish Mark, who has his father's same notions of class and status, and the treatment of his social inferiors.Tempers flare and passions ignite, with plot twists and turns between those upstairs and those downstairs, the masters and mistresses and the servants.  Plans are thwarted, alliances and friendships forged.Against the backdrop of horses and airplanes, the viewer becomes party to the lives of its characters in much the way Downton Abbey captured so many viewers' hearts.For a 1979 production, this might not be as slick a production as Downton Abbey, but the tale is certain worth watching.\",\n",
              "       \"Sadly, there was something here, a seed of potential that I so wished had a chance to grow into a scenario that no doubt lies in the realm of the possible. Particularly given Australia's proximal location to China - and the Dragon's seeming unstoppable expansion in the east.But this Aussie 'Red Dawn' failed on so many levels. It's difficult to categorize without doing a pile on.For starters, this would've been more enjoyable had the filmmakers' standards been set at less pretty in favor of more character. The worst was Caitlin Stasey playing hardworking farm girl Ellie turned rebel insurgent. About as genuine and appropriate for the role as choosing Snooki at becoming a Green Beret.With those poor selections, from the get-go, the film had an air of a exaggerated falsehood. The entire cast made up of much-too-worldly, self-aware juniors wrecking the foundation of what I felt had the kernel for something quite good. And because that foundational element never takes hold, we're never fully invested in the movie's reality, in accepting the drama as depicted. Populated by thespian school hopefuls parading as actors, they're clearly not ready for the big screen.Again, highlighting Caitlin's performance as lead character Ellie, whose oscillations between overacting and underplayed made this retread all the more difficult to screen. Example: When her character and Corrie were in the playhouse. Yikes, what an absolutely terrible execution. I'm surprised she didn't put the back of her hand to her forehead and made some monstrously trite pronouncement. Just one of an incredible array of terrible cringe worthy scenes. The campsite scene at 1:13 in the film ... I can't even begin to start without writing a thesis on ham-fisted melodrama - both written and execution.One has to lay the primary blame at the feet of Director Stuart Beattie. It was his ineptitude that led these drama students down the merry path toward incompetence.A few more blatantly ridiculous bits that helped heave this into silliness:- We have these kids driving around on motorcycles, ATVs and SUVs - in the daytime no less. I'm not looking for fully authentic combat realism, but c'mon. I know what some of my fellow vets are thinking, Small town. Small force. Unexpected resistance. Got that. But let's look at the flip side. Your company, a presumption given the approximately 100-150 enemy seen, is going to be tasked with subduing this backwater village. There has to be some intelligence. I mean even a basic satellite reconnaissance like Google Earth will reveal the general lay of the land, where the population is spread. And S2 should have a general idea of population count, types of housing, key civilian leadership, etc. It's not like these guys went in there completely blind. So yeah, once you have most of the populace under control, you immediately set out to cull the hold outs, the hideaways homebounds, etc. You never remain static. You're going to set-up a series of posts - fixed, fixed concealed, and roaming. No way a bunch of vehicles goes tearing around without one of your posts picking up either ambient noise or movement, most especially in a rural township. This isn't a city - sound travels far.- Why does everyone's makeup look so even throughout the movie? One of the reasons the original 'Red Dawn' worked was you could see how plain everyone was being virtually makeup free. And, most importantly, looked progressively worse as the film went on - which of course makes complete sense. I'm thinking specifically of Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey who were almost unrecognizable by the movie's final&eacute;. That all the females in 'Tomorrow' had their hair and makeup intact throughout the flick doomed this to a laughable unreality.- My favorite quote, You're bleeding!. Yes, thank you Captain Obvious. The fact that a half dozen soldiers are firing fully-automatic assault weapons at you might, just might, incur some injury and blood loss. You know, with the shattered front shield and all. So let's tack on atrocious screenwriting to this flick.- Additionally, the clich&eacute;d trope of the 'checklist' - the working girl, the good girl, the portly (naturally) religious girl, the beauty, the likable average guy who turns out to be a coward (and will likely die a hero saving everyone in the upcoming films), the troublemaker, and of course, the token person of color - which I'm surprised wasn't an Aboriginal. Predictably derivative to a fault. People, all people, find friendship in a shared commodity. Whether that's work, an association, or even a hobby, there's always a common thread. What you don't have, not ever, are seven completely different people from wholly divergent backgrounds hanging out with one another. This formula only works with two basic movie constructs: Juries and certain kinds of natural disasters. Well, those and a Coca-Cola commercial.I understand this is the first of a trilogy. Yikes. If you hit rock bottom, I suppose things can only get better. The scary part - if I were a fan? I don't think they've hit the bottom yet. It'll be interesting to screen the newly rebooted 'Red Dawn' coming out later this year, if only for comparison's sake.Movie Note:- Director Beattie should be embarrassed and ashamed for not hiring one veteran from the Aussie SAS to help advise his production. I counted something like 50 people in the Effects Dept, another 30 or so in SFX, 30 in Sound, etc, etc. The one guy they desperately needed in this film, more than all that fluff and special effects, he ignored.It shows. It really shows.- If this type of film is what you're looking for, I recommend watching the tv series 'Jericho' instead.\",\n",
              "       \"It's a harmless summer action film that wasn't as horrible as the critics and dilettante cineastes would lead you to believe.  Some variation on the SETI Project has been trying to communicate with the Gliese 581 star system, and the response to those calls is a small invasion force that cordons off Hawaii in a force field to test our potential response to a full-scale invasion.  The aliens just happened to pick the time when the annual RIMPAC naval war games are being conducted, and although the vast majority of the US Pacific Fleet and several other nations are on the outside, it's ultimately up to the Aegis destroyer USS John Paul Jones and its screwup tactical action officer Alex Hopper to save the world after all the other ships trapped inside the force field and all of Hawaii's bases are summarily massacred in the first encounter.Its affiliation withthe board gameis fleeting and 98% ancillary, and could've been left out altogether without anybody noticing: the only connections to it are that the invading aliens occasionally fire peg-shaped munitions, and the only time they call out the letter-number sequences when shooting is after cobbling together a fire control method by overlaying NOAA map grids onto the tsunami warning buoy network because the aliens' ships don't appear on radar and the aliens themselves are so light-sensitive that they have to wear welder's masks in normal sunlight.

The story is simple.  Woman's testimony puts charismatic boyfriend serial killer away.  Serial killer escapes and returns to former girlfriend.  In the course of these events, woman picks up a pudgy-faced new boyfriend and tries to get on with her life.  The narrative is slow and often boring.  Many of the dialogues hardly move the plot along.  The climax is almost worth the wait, but one gets the feeling the whole film revolved around those last 5 or 10 minutes or so---and that everything else before it was padding and filler.  The serial killer, played by AJ Bowen, is about the only interesting character in the film.  Everyone else seems to be merely mouthing the lines.  It is in those moments when Bowen is on-screen, however, that the film almost seems to take on a creepy life of its own.  Not the greatest of thrillers, but it could have been a lot worse.\",\n",
              "       \"Reportedly the biggest box-office hit in India's film history, Endhiran (meaning robot in Tamil) is exactly what entertainment should be. It has romance, great music and lots of action. The film is flawed, but is never boring, and that is the most important thing in this Kollywood blockbuster.The Tamil superstar Rajinikanth plays a genius scientist Dr. Vaseekaran, who has created a super-powered, hyper-intelligent robot Chitti in his own image (played by Rajinikanth). This should be a breakthrough for the world of robotics, but things go wrong when Chitti is made to have its own emotions. In short, Chitti falls in love with the doctor's girlfriend Sana (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan).Some film fans may remember Aishwarya Rai Bachchan as the heroine of Bride & Prejudice, a modern-day, cross-cultural version of Jane Austen's classic novel. It has been more than ten years since I first saw her in a Hindi film Straight from the Heart, and she was very impressive then. In Endhiran she plays Sana, the doctor's neglected sweetheart, and lets her comedic side shine with her charming interaction with Rajinikanth.The story of Endhiran is uneven and it takes itself too seriously at some points. The special effects also vary in quality; some are nice, some not so. But when action kicks in, the film delivers. Director Shankar employs an anything goes style in action, and it works: kung-fu fighting in a train (choreographed by Yuen Woo-ping); Matrix Reloaded-style car action on the highway; and non-stop combat sequence involving an army of robots (imagine lots of Schwarzenegger's Terminator) attacking like Decepticons of Transformers.The soundtrack is composed by Oscar-winning musician A.R. Rahman (Slumdog Millionaire and many others). The film also has impressive musical scenes, some of which are shot in Len&oacute;is Maranhenses National Park, Brazil and Machu Picchu, Peru. Also, there is one musical segment (set inside Chitti's head!), in which the stars are seen dancing to a catchy techno-pop number with metallic robot dancers.In short Endhiran is fun with lots of great visual ideas. Trivia: Rajinikanth returns as Chitti in a cameo in Ra.One starring Shah Rukh Khan, who was originally cast as Dr. Vaseekaran / Chitti, but left the project.\",\n",

              "       \"As one of the internet's resident scribes on all things movie, I'll not be the first - nor certainly the last - to lambast the treatment JOHN CARTER received at the box office.  The short version of this sad history is that JOHN CARTER was the perfect popcorn flick that deserved better - better from fans, better from the studio who made the film, and (far, far) better from the critical community that mostly drubbed it a `disaster' for all the wrong reasons - and, hopefully, it will get better at some point because, arguably, there's no better inspiration for science fiction and fantasy than Edgar Rice Burroughs' 1917 novel that started the craze.Others have already gone to great lengths to dissect precisely how badly conceived was Walt Disney's marketing scheme for the picture, but, to be honest, I think the failings of the film to garner the success it deserved from the box office goes much deeper.  How do you take a book titled A Princess of Mars and, then, make a film that goes through so many name changes that it ends up with something as simple as JOHN CARTER?  Not even JOHN CARTER OF MARS, as it was briefly called by some executive who, at least, realized it might be worthwhile to reference Burroughs' original material?  I think a strong case could be made - and probably will be made in some astute article some day by a film scholar - that the property was put in the hands of folks who didn't quite know what to do with it.  Is it STAR WARS?  Is it CONAN, THE BARBARIAN?  Is it STAR TREK?In short, JOHN CARTER was based on the best example of pulp fiction available to all of mankind.  Burroughs' original classic served as an inspiration to not only the best writers in the science fiction & fantasy field, but it led folks like George Lucas and Steven Spielberg to want to make movies in their respective universes.  Burroughs' prose has even been cited as an inspiration to Carl Sagan and even astronaut Terrence Wilcutt.  While the question will remain for ages why the film wasn't as successful as it deserved to be, it stands to reason that the original creation will continue to inspire countless folks in the years ahead.Taylor Kitsch does an admirable job bringing the principle character of Carter to life on the silver screen, and the lovely Lynn Collins steals every young boy's heart as the princess herself, Dejah Thoris.  The film was heavily supported by special effects, as many of the inhabitants of Mars had to be mastered with CGI.  Willem Dafoe was the most noticeable voice talent as Tars Tarkas, while James Purefoy performed respectably as Kantos Kan.  The effects were all top-notch - though a handful of sequences appeared a bit too elementary for my tastes - and they were integrated fairly seamlessly with the live action.While much could be made about the ineffective marketing by Disney's usually stellar advertising staff, I tend to think that the confusion over the property itself - just who is this John Carter character? - really killed any momentum the picture could've achieved.  In fact, the film never tracked all the well in the lead-up to its release, and if that doesn't indicate some fault on the part of the advertisers then I don't know who to blame.  Clearly, Burroughs' creation has an audience.  Disney never quite tapped into it, and that's probably because no one involved in drafting a marketing plan was even familiar with the franchise.  Instead, they relied on the picture - which dabbled liberally in the adventures on Barsoom (aka Mars) - and they were undone as a consequence.Having read most of the first novel, I can say that the story that made it to the silver screen is a respectful adaptation, but it strayed from the source material like any adaption does.  There was so much more to these various tribes and cultures in the book that may've made for a greater plot - not to mention the depth of characters that were reduced to general devices instead of fully fleshed creations - and, audience attention span being what it is, I can understand why some folks may've struggled a bit to grasp it all.  The central good-versus-evil story could've used a bit more beefing up, but, at the end of the day, I can't help but wonder how much of it seemed a bit too much like `fluff' for kids (not that there's anything wrong with that!).Lastly, I thought the pacing of the film suffered a bit in the middle third of the picture.  There's a fair amount of set-up that occupies the first third, and, where most second acts build on the drama and mystery of these introductions, JOHN CARTER sort of struggled and groped around a bit to find the story it wanted to tell.  The third act is, mostly, a traditional adventure picture, and it works very well on that level ... but the uneven presentation of that second act may've helped stifle strong word-of-mouth from audience members mostly unfamiliar with the material.  I can remember thinking that, after I saw the film, the story as presented might worked better had it been expanded to either two or three films; the end result of this would've been to give storytellers more space to work with fleshing out the people, places, and history of Barsoom - much in the same way Peter Jackson did with THE LORD OF THE RINGS films - but, alas, it wasn't meant to be.With as much as Disney spent on JOHN CARTER, it'll always remain a bit of a mystery as to why the finished product wasn't as successful as it could've been.  I think we'll be debating it for the ages, but, in the meantime, there's absolutely nothing wrong with enjoying the film as is: a rip-roaring return to old school entertainment ... where men are men ... dogs are, well, big dogs ... and there's a princess and a bunch of rather obvious villains thrown into the mix.  While it only hints at the magic from the original STAR WARS trilogy, JOHN CARTER will hopefully continue to be discovered and rediscovered in the generations yet to experience it.STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.\",\n",

The back story to this iconic, historic album was made with the full cooperation, involvement and approval of The Doors.Mr. Mojo Risin' is told by way of brand new interviews with Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger and John Densmore.  There are also interviews with the band's original manger, Bill Siddons, and Elektra Records founder, Jac Holzman and the album's engineer/producer, Bruce Botnick and a ton of other people tied to the band or the record at that time.For geeks like me who love to hear how a song comes together, you'll hear the guys share how the hits that the album generated came about.  It's always amazing how landmark sounds came about as almost an afterthought or fluke.  Live and studio performances and a boat load of great, rare archival photos make this DVD a real treat for Doors fans.I'm a sucker for discoveries of long, lost stuff and this DVD sucks me right in with the previously unreleased blues tune, She Smells So Nice.  The vocal track is a little on the scratchy side but that's what adds to its appeal, as far as I'm concerned.  Morrison sounds like he's having a blast with the song.  It would've been great if Jim and the boys had also cut an entire blues album before his untimely death.The documentary also reminded me of something that I had forgotten and that was that Elvis Presley's bass player, Jerry Scheff, did the bass work on this album.  I'm sure Mr. Scheff will shed some light about this project from his perspective when his autobiography comes out in March.  Stay tuned.Regarding Morrison's passing, the guys do discuss the subject in a frank way that still seems to reveal the feeling that they still can't believe he's gone. Conspiracy theorists who feel that Morrison didn't really die in 1971 will not see any hits of a smoking gun in this movie that will support their theory.  Nor is there any discussion about the theory that the Lizard King murdered for whatever reason.  I would've been surprised and disappointed if the subjects were discussed.I got the sense from watching this documentary that the guys still have a love for Morrison as well as for each other that only a tight band of brothers can have.  It's great hearing these guys share their stories and insights into this landmark album as well as the life inside - and dynamic of - the mind.The production quality of Mr. Mojo Risin' is excellent.  The editing and flow is crisp and clean.  The selection of material is bang-on.  Like all great movies and documentaries, it leaves you wanting more.  Sadly, after this DVD (with the exception of She Smells So Nice) , it's highly unlikely that there is any more.Avid Doors fans as well as rock music historians will want to have this DVD in their personal collection and will watch many, many times.Mr. Mojo Risin': The Story of L.A.

Add in the fact that this is a single concert vs an amalgam of performances, and we may have the winner.Historical note and another great thing about the video: In the movie, Keef's hair is still '70s elegance, and with his legitimate '70s getup he almost looks beautiful. Cut to the Saturday Night Live performances, and we see the latter-day Keef hairdo, missing only the fishing hooks and other gew-gaws that eventually made their way into his tangled locks. An intriguing transition, and I'm sure I'll glean more bits as I marvel at this amalgam.\",\n",

If PARIAH is indicative of the quality of films she will create, then we are in for a new level of verismo cinema. She tackles a tough subject - same sex relationships among African American women - with such insight and care to details that her film jumps off the screen screaming as in the words of her heroine `I'm not running - I'm choosing': lesbian girls are not God's mistake (to quote the mother figure) but instead have the courage to accept their difference and embrace their sexuality and still become successful members of society.Alike/Lee (Adepero Oduye, a fine young actress who hails from Brooklyn by way of Nigeria, a graduate of Cornell University who has studied acting with Wynn Handman, Austin Pendleton, and Susan Batson) is a 17-year old sexually conflicted girl who lives in Brooklyn with her younger very bright sister Sharonda (Sahra Mellesse) and her parents - police detective father Arthur (Charles Parnell) and conservative, overprotective, biased mother Audrey (Kim Wayans). Alike is an excellent student, a blossoming poet, and a lesbian: she maintains tow life styles complete with clothes changes so that she can be the `daughter' at home and herself outside the home. Alike's best friend Laure (Pernell Walker) is her support system as Laure is comfortable about being out as a lesbian. Alike's home life is strained as her ever arguing parents disagree on many factors, on of them being Alike's need to appear like a man. Audrey arranges for Alike to become friends with Bina (Aasha Davis) who is the daughter of one of Audrey's friends, an encouragement that eventually leads to Alike's surprise first sexual experience with a girl who is just `doing her own thing' - ie, not a lesbian. This deeply affects Alike, she delves more deeply into her poetry and graduates early because of her shining school record. At a point of no return she is confronted by her parents and the manner in which she makes her decision as to `run or choose' provides the ending of the story.The cast is uniformly strong and though Adepero Oduye makes a show-stopping debut, the other actors are equally superb. Bradford Young is the cinematographer who helps create the atmosphere. The dialogue is delivered in street language and is often covered with shouting and with multiple characters talking simultaneously: subtitles help here. But the genius of the film is in the concept and the courage and in the amazing gift for creating meaning cinema that comes across as the work of Dee Rees.  She is a talent to watch.

              "       'A captivating, cheering, theologically confounding, contrived movie about an historic underdog triumph in the 1957 Little League World Series that triumphs in spite of self-inflicted wounds. It is hard to imagine many real-life stories more dramatic, inspiring and compelling than this one, and it would have been better served by a telling minus all the medallion-at-the-last-moment scenes and clich&eacute;s. Also, sometimes the film seems to be telling a story involving Catholic theology, but other times, like the song When You Can See Forever, it seems to be more meology. In spite of these distractions, the story is so good that the film overcomes them, much as the Little Giants overcame their obstacles.

The plot is a Shakespearean tragedy like Macbeth or King Lear, the  dialogue, photography, cinematography and the supporting cast is wonderful, especially the actors who play the consigliere Ezra Stone, Cain's wife and daughter. There's a scene in the last episode where Cain is standing in front of a mural that I won't describe so as not to spoil it that shows his true character. There's also a hit man that is scary as hell.

That's what they used to sell the thing, the rest is just the usual action-movie bag of tricks.  Nothing in the screenplay makes the remotest amount of sense. I particularly like the irony of a movie filmed largely in an Arab country - but featuring a Swedish terrorist.This is unquestionably the worst-written, worst-directed, worst-acted and worst-edited film I've seen in years.  And as for the sequence of Cruise climbing the Burj Khalifa, it had all the suspense of watching Jello set.  It was patently obvious that the film-makers had build a horizontal facade, so that, rather than climbing, Cruise is actually crawling along the thing, wearing a ridiculous pair of suction gloves.Cruise at least tried to juice the thing up.

It's not Stephen Spielberg; it's not touchy-feely; it's not subtle; and it's not dark and mysterious.What it is, though, is a wild, tongue-in-cheek, faaaaabulous homage to those really, really bad slasher movies that somehow get financing and a distribution deal.  The whole thing plays like an inside joke, only you're in on it.  If the movie strikes you at first as awful, realize that the awfulness is on purpose.  If it seems way over the top and, frankly, totally unbelievable, even for a horror movie, keep in mind that the movie-makers intended it to be that way.I knew absolutely nothing about this movie or the people who made it, but I learned that the woman who plays the Elvira character was in it.  Cassandra Peterson has starred in a couple of spoofy comedy movies as Elvira and I enjoyed their campy-ness, as well as Ms. Peterson's adorable, stand-out personality and talent as a comedic actress.In this movie, Ms. Peterson plays a concerned mother of a teenage boy.  The Elvira costume, wig, and makeup are gone.  She plays the role straight--i.e., no buffoonery or hamming it up.  And even though she isn't using comedy to act, her skills as a dramatic actress shine and are just as fascinating to watch.  She isn't given a lot of screen time, but that's okay because her brief appearance lends a spark of credibility to the motion picture.It's also deliciously ironic that Ms. Peterson does not appear in drag as Elvira because there is so much drag in the rest of the movie.  The man who directed the film also stars in it as a female -- a big, overly exaggerated version of a female, to be precise.  And there are plenty of other eye-popping, alternative characters to prompt the casual viewer to wonder, What the heck am I looking at?  Yet, despite how some of these aspects in other movies might turn off some viewers, this film manages to stay just this side of the line of not too bizarre for mainstream audiences.The EXTRAS on the DVD explain everything -- who the director is, how he brought the film to fruition, and how he (Joshua Grannell) as a she (Peaches Christ) obtained such a huge cult following by appearing in movie theaters to host showings of really, really bad horror films.The quality of the DVD audio and video is excellent.

              "       \"Once Christmas has elapsed and good tidings are gone, it's only natural that our minds turn to horror cinema and, specifically, to the business of the zombie apocalypse (because you never know). As such, in the interest of self-preservation, it behooves us all to keep apprised of all zombie film releases. Case in point, RAMMBOCK BERLIN UNDEAD.I'm always hoping to pick up new survival tips from these walking dead pictures. Sadly, RAMMBOCK offers not much fresh illumination. It's a good thing there are other more helpful, info-friendly zombie films out there, else you can pretty much kiss humanity goodbye when the zombie apocalypse falls upon us. From purely a movie buff's perspective, I suppose that you can savor the pretty decent acting and the film's focus on characterization. As ever, a zombie flick's success depends on whether the viewer can latch onto the characters and emotionally invest in them. And I appreciate the lack of stupidity exhibited by the characters. Other than that chick yelling from her window, I didn't have much occasion to roll my eyes. But it's important to keep in mind that while zombies are indeed undead, it doesn't mean that they're deaf.The plot has an Austrian bloke named Michael traveling from Vienna to Berlin to drop in unannounced on his ex-girlfriend, Gabi, ostensibly to return her keys but, really, to see if he can rekindle that old flame. Except that he chooses to do this just as the zombie infestation was in the offing. In Gabi's cramped apartment, Michael evicts an infected plumber and horrifyingly learns that Gabi isn't home, having just stepped out for a mite, or so the young plumber's assistant, Harper, informs Michael. With zombies feverishly prowling and feasting outside, Michael and Harper find no recourse but to barricade themselves in Gabi's apartment. How it must've sucked when their sole bridge to the outside world - the television in which the networks had promised to keep viewers apprised of the epidemic - begins to show test patterns.RAMMBOCK BERLIN UNDEAD - in German with English sub-titles - is solid if unspectacular. It clocks in at a no-nonsense 61 minutes. The survivalist story takes place in the confines of an apartment block and, unfortunately for this tiny pocket of humanity, these zombies aren't the plodding, shambling kind. This contagion is more in keeping with the rage virus from 28 DAYS LATER, and so the deceased tend to flit around like Carl friggin' Lewis. The talking heads on the idiot box are pretty pointed about warning those who get infected to stay calm as losing one's cool would propel the virus to take effect even sooner.One nugget I did walk away with from this film: zombies may have aversion for bright lights. Survivalists all over should already be well stocked on batteries and halogen lamps. But maybe you should get an extra supply? You may not be as lucky as the cast of HAMMBOCK whose zombies demonstrate the courtesy of not being much in the film. There are occasional frenzied bursts of action as swarming infected maniacs compel the few survivors to fight their way out and scurry from room to room. But gorehounds will be disappointed by the lack of icky gore - or kill scenes, for that matter. Oh, and Michael does eventually find his ex-girlfriend Gabi. But, by then, he's lost the keys.The DVD's bonus stuff:- Zombiefication - tongue-in-cheek safety tips on how to survive exposure to zombies, except that this is just regurgitated material for old hands like us (00:07:04 minutes)- The Making of RAMMBOCK (in German, with English sub-titles; 00:15:52 minutes)\",\n",

              "       \"What kind of mentality hires a guy with exactly one major film under his belt, a quiet study-your-belly-button arthouse flick no less, to deliver on such a large action stage? I'm truly stunned. And despite what the numbers say, it's just as important to look at the breakdown. BoxOfficeMojo has this reboot a big time winner, but look carefully. Out of the $743M total receipts on a reported budget of $230M, not including a massive advertising campaign, check out how much came from domestic sales. Pretty much dead even with the budget. Very, very telling.Not particularly surprised, but very disappointed this new creative team intentionally injecting vampire angst into this story. Done while simultaneously fumbling and sacrificing the action aspect. Why?Add to that let down: Twenty-eight year old Andrew Garfield's surprisingly unsympathetic characterization in a role that was perfectly crafted to appeal to the youth market. Seriously, what bullied kid didn't want to have super powers at least once as an outcast teenager? But this guy, wow, very nearly drained the fun out the character. Bordering very close to callow goth territory sans the white face paint and mascara.And were there three subplots because there were three writers - each having to have their say? Collaborative efforts without a stern arbiter usually ends poorly. This being a prime example. An inconsistent script filled with unfinished threads and underhanded fiscal motivations:Examples:- Unfinished. What happened to Peter's fervent desire to find the man with the tattoo? Guess Gwen sorta swept the young man off his feet. Really? He's that shallow that Uncle Ben becomes nothing more than a trivial side-story? The bitter memory of self-indulgence that made Peter such a great hero - to never again let his personal b.s. overcome his greater responsibility - is completely obliterated in this version of Spidey. Pathetic.And in comparison, how utterly bizarre was it that Peter was more emotionally devastated at the loss of his girlfriend's father - a man he barely knew? Truly unbelievable. &lt;shaking head in dismay>- Underhanded. The moment Peter celebrates the full extent of his powers is via skateboard. Good gravy. What marketing bleep-hole forced that onto the movie? Why not showcase all the X-Games skills with bottles of Mountain Dew strewn about and be done with it? Shoot, why not just skip all the pretense and have Peter winning the X-Games and save us all the trouble?There were a few moments, lost in amongst the uneven editing, where there were glimpses of something wonderful and grand; where the actors touched us, the audience, and delivered something beyond the script. But those scenes were too little to save this production from mediocrity.This production is much less a reboot and more a twisted hybrid of commercial desires leeching off a dependable workhorse like a parasitic remora. Having paid my fee - I slogged through to the routine violin-synched melodramatic finish.Sony is doing something I never conceived: Killing the Golden Goose in order to eat goose.It doesn't make for good movies, but it makes interesting spectacle. Viewing shortsighted greed overwhelm better, smarter products. Sort of the gastronomic equivalent of watching McDonald's make their hamburgers without hamburger meat while telling everyone how great their new burgers will be. How long before people catch on? Is there a chance to save the franchise? This new business model interests me and, sadly, was the biggest attraction in screening the flick.Movie Notes:- I was going to say I felt sorry for Denis Leary but realized - bleep it - he got paid. The man's laughing cause it's not his movie.- Liked the C. Thomas Howell cameo. Man keeps chugging along. Proof that character actors can make a decent living in the industry.- Interestingly, and without intent, I screened a pair ofRhys Ifans films less than a week apart. Talk about a diametric contrast. Gifted actor lost in this bland commercial gristmill.\",\n",

There are movie's that win awards and get critical acclaim, that pale in comparison to the raise the bar of this movie, in my opinion.The movie follows two parents, having issues with their marriage, as they find out their only child, has just opened fire at his local school, and then turned the gun on himself.  I can't even imagine the aftermath of that.What I found so interesting about this particular story, is that it's very rare stories get made from the perspective of someone who is NOT the victim (i.e. their child was not the one who was shot by the alleged killer).  It's a look at the other side of the coin.  Watching the movie, made me think about that other perspective, that other experience.  I like movies that make you think of things you wouldn't normally.The story unfolds as the parents try and make sense of it, try and deal with all the media, and being suddenly thrust out into the spotlight of judgement.  It also brings up issues in their marriage, of course it would as would any type of extreme stress.Okay, maybe not a feel good movie, but still an excellent story, excellent raw acting, great directing.

              "       \"The question that Lockout raises that requires the most pondering from a savvy viewer is, can a single performance be so unexpected, offbeat and exuberant as to make a bad movie good. Well, not good I suppose, but it can make a humdrum experience more entertaining, interesting, and outright fun. That is precisely what Guy Pearce does for the generic genre exercise Lockout.Playing Snow, no first name given, unless it is also Snow.  A former CIA operative, turned outlaw, framed for a crime he didn't commit. Snow is given a choice, spend thirty years cryogenically frozen in prison or go in alone to a penal colony orbiting in space to rescue the US President's daughter (Maggie Grace from Taken), who is caught up as a hostage in a prison riot.If this sounds familiar it's because Lockout, the latest potboiler from the bane of the French critics existence Luc Besson, shamelessly  rips off John Carpenter's films Escape From New York, Escape From L.A. and to a lesser degree Assault on Prescient 13. Even a once speculated third installment to be titled Escape From Earth. However, budgetary restrictions and a recycled script of derivative characters and clich&eacute; dialogue makes this come across more like a Roger Corman knock off of Carpenter, which the right audience will find appealing.The only thing that really allows Lockout to stand out, to rise above it's middling limitations is it's star performance from Guy Pearce. A long under used leading man, here Pearce shines in a character clearly patterned after Kurt Russell's Snake Plisskan, Snake  still is a cooler name than Snow. Pearce brings a sense of wit, sarcasm and a lazy anti-hero streak that would make Bogie look like Sly Stallone.Going full on commando as the chain smoking, wise cracking rebel hero, Pearce is hard not to like here. He is such a good casting choice, because he is so unexpected in the role, where a Jason Statham or Gerard Butler would have seemed as tired as the material. This is an old school sci-fi actioner, we've seen it all before, it's exhaustedly plagiaristic, but at a well paced 96 minutes and with such an amicable star performance, some how this keeps from showing all it's obvious cracks.Lacking the artificial depth of so many of Besson's recent out put, this picture works as pure unflinching fluff. Sometimes that is just what an audience wants, even I have fallen victim to such primitive desires, but here Pearce adds the spark to the ignition that turns this puppy over to something a little more resembling a quality picture.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com\",\n",

Malcolm McDowell is non-conformist Mick Travis who, with his like-minded friends, stages small acts of rebellion and defiance for which they are punished with severe beatings.At the time of initial release, the movie was considered dangerous and a possible incitement to violence against the powers-that-be.  And in many ways, it was (and still is)!The film was editorialized as a dangerous, irresponsible film (not unlike A CLOCKWORK ORANGE or Z).

Hurtling at incomprehensible speeds this unidentified bogie is still vulnerable to missile bombardment from Homeland Security. And when Santa falls off the sleigh and crashes onto the docks, it's up to a pair of kids to save him - and Christmas - from an obsessed FBI agent.In Special Agent Erickson's (Greg Germann) defense, he thinks he's doing the world a solid. He's brushed up on extraterrestrial conspiracies. For years he's been tracking what he believes to be the human element in the intruder network. But Special Agent Erickson is in the wrong film genre. This 2010 holiday flick, THE SANTA INCIDENT, is fantasy, not science-fiction. There may be folks onscreen with pointy ears, but they're not Vulcans. They're little helpers. Or, to be even more specific, they're the North Pole Search & Rescue party.Santa Claus (James Cosmo) ends up in the local hospital, being monitored by Nurse Joanna Johnson (Ione Skye) who also happens to be those two kids' mother. Stranded and with less than a week to go before Christmas and still needing to make the toys, Santa is taken in by the Johnsons. And, no, we won't question the soundness of a mother's inviting an absolute stranger over to one's home. It's Christmastime. Let's all buy into that whole good will toward men approach.THE SANTA INCIDENT is cute and silly and over-the-top. Above all, it's intended for kids, many of whom should get a kick out of the film's moments of mild skullduggery and Santa's collecting discarded scraps and shaping toys out of them. The grown-ups may find themselves raising their eyebrows some at Greg Germann's exaggerated bluster. I did chuckle a bit at his comic interactions with his inexperienced FBI partner. For the grown-ups, there's a smidge of romance as well. Fair warning, Ione Skye doesn't get wooed in near an epic fashion as she did in SAY ANYTHING. But, to reiterate, this movie isn't for the love birds. It's for the kids. 3 out of 5 stars.\",\n",

              "       \"My favorite comment in this documentary is offered by Pete Hamill, American journalist, novelist and essayist, who said basically if you want people to brush their teeth, pass a law banning toothpaste. And then people will do everything they can to acquire toothpaste illegally, and they'll brush their teeth just to spite the law. The unforeseen consequence of Prohibition is that once you take away a person's right to do something that people have always done, people will feel the desire to want it much more intensely, in the same way if you deny a child all sweets, the kid will be sneaking chocolate inside his jacket sleeves. Hamill later says he doesn't drink, but he would probably take a swig in front of a government building if the law ever forbade him from doing it. Encouraging moderation is not the same as banning something completely.The other comment worth noting concerns repeal crusader Pauline Sabin who had been entrenched in republican politics prior to 1928. Republican congressmen would vote to adhere to the strictest of prohibition laws as laid out by the Volstead Act and then go to one of Sabin's parties demanding a drink. She concluded that the United States had become a Nation of Hypocrites, which is the title of the third installment of Burn's documentary. Sabin becomes an unlikely hero who would sway the country against Prohibition and the eventual repeal of the 18th Amendment of the Constitution, the only amendment so dignified. Ironically, Daniel Okrent points out that today alcohol is somewhat harder to come by than during Prohibition because of liquor laws, underage drinking laws, etc. When alcohol was strictly forbidden, there was nothing in place to regulate it, except for raids on speakeasies and private distilleries.Based in part on Daniel Okrent's Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition, Ken Burns and Lynn Novick's Prohibition is a thoroughly entertaining, simultaneously humorous and sobering look at one of the strangest episodes in American legal history. The documentary is in three parts, the first chronicling the birth of the temperance movement which began in the 1820's almost a century before the ratification of the 18th Amendment. No question that alcohol was a problem for some people, mostly among the rural poor, but the temperance movement decided alcohol itself was the problem and vowed its eradication by the late 19th century. The first part ends with the ratification of the 18th Amendment to the US Constitution prohibiting not only the sale but importation of alcohol. Part two concerns the passage of the Volstead Act designed to enforce the amendment, and the immediate consequences of trying to stop people from drinking, and the antithetical results, such as lawlessness and bribery. The third and most sobering of the episodes chronicles many of the unintended consequences, such as the violence erupting in Chicago and the night club craze. The documentary ends with the movement for the repeal of the 18th Amendment.The unforeseen catastrophes of the 18th Amendment which were designed to heighten American morality and assuage drunkenness turned America into one of the most alcoholic-driven nations among the industrialized world. Americans drank more booze, partied more, got more drunk, and flaunted the law more often during Prohibition than at any other time in the nation's history since after the Civil War, even as compared to the present time. Possibly only the 1960's are somewhat comparable to the mayhem of the 1920's.The irony of ironies that the decade begun by the Temperance Movement's victory with the passage of the 18th Amendment to the US Constitution in 1919 would be nicknamed the Roarding Twenties and the Jazz Age. This was not a decade known for drinking milk. This was a decade characterized by cocktail glasses in the hands of flappers dancing on tables to the evocative music of Duke Ellington and Count Basie. Men would be raising giant mugs of frothy beer in underground establishments called speakeasies. Only Prohibition allowed the likes of Al Capone and Lucky Luciano to become wealthy gangsters, almost movie stars by today's standards. The leaders of the Temperance Movement, particularly the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the Anti-Saloon League, were appalled when their daughters ran off to speakeasies and night clubs to partake of the forbidden fruit. Strangely, Prohibition helped usher in the Night Club culture of America which has continued unabated ever since. All the great night clubs famous for their booze, music, and dancing such as the Cotton Club and the Stork Club, were incepted when alcohol was supposed to be illegal.For some reason, I didn't think Prohibition permeated into so many aspects of American life during its enforcement from 1920 through 1932. People could open small businesses in their basements and make a fortune through bootlegging, and then be hauled away under the Volstead Act. The rise of the Chicago Gang syndicate became a prototype for similar syndicates across the country, all vying for their bootlegging territory. At one point, citizens were legally compelled to snitch on neighbors suspected of bootlegging. The story as presented by Burns/Novick is as compelling as any action thriller being produced today. A great movie of American history, with all the elements that make a great story. Essentially it's a legal thriller with sex, violence, and lots of booze. Lots of it.\",\n",

It isn't challenging in the slightest, which has caused many critics to downgrade it, or damn it with faint praise. All I know is that the audience in the packed theater where I saw the film applauded at the end, and I applauded with them.By now everyone knows the story of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. A group of English retirees decides for various reasons (mostly financial) to move to India. The retirement hotel they choose sounds glorious from the brochure, but turns out to be a rundown, if once-grand, hulk run by a young Indian with much more enthusiasm than skill. A lot of comedy ensues, and a little conflict and tragedy; attitudes are changed, old bonds broken, and new bonds forged.The ensemble cast of British character actors ranges among the super-famous (Judi Dench, Maggie Smith), the moderately famous (Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy, Penelope Wilton) and the not-so-famous (Ronald Pickup, Celia Imrie), with the addition of one young rising star (Dev Patel, of Slumdog Millionaire fame). All of them are as charming, funny and touching as they possibly could be. Meanwhile, Madden and screenwriter Ol Parker do an excellent job of blending and articulating the various plotlines, aided by the gorgeous photography by Ben Davis and the insinuating score by Thomas Newman. Considering the effort all these master professionals made to give an audience a good time, it seems churlish to give The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel any less than five stars.\",\n",

If you give obeisance to its logic, you forfeit any chance of really enjoying anything in a human way. It is the death of real art, insight, and depth. But, a certain TMZ logic appeals as well, feeding the human need to know something, even if trivial. I saw some of this documentary on TV, later heard the so-called Dr. Drew's disquisition on it with the auteur Grenier. The best thing I can say about the former is that he hit a high-note of confabulation by construing celebrity worship as a form of modern Aztec Temple religiosity. (I am not making this up!) And what can you say about Grenier but that he is cute. Hollywood is convinced that if they look hard enough they will find something socially telling or profound about the pseudo-culture they create. The only honesty is that it is the vacuum of entertainment. Meaning nothing, giving nothing, achieving nothing. They are searching for a transvaluation of values, and there is none, only money, and sops to money.\",\n",

We want to buy the extended because the extra footage from LOTRs made LOTRs a better movie. This extended version of The Hobbit does not make it a better movie. It doesn't make it a bad movie. It's pretty much the same with 30 extra minutes. I did not feel the story was expanded in a better way and I did not feel the characters were explained in more detail. The pacing felt a little slower because of the extra 30 minutes. There is a lot more singing in this version, I will say that. It has two more musical numbers in it which makes that four songs in total. If you didn't read the book then the songs will mean nothing, but fans of the book will love more of the songs. It began to feel like a musical though.If you are on the fence about whether or not to buy the extended or the theatrical it all depends on if you don't mind watching 30 minutes more of this movie.If you already own the theatrical version I would recommend renting the extended first and seeing how you like it. I will recommend if you have a 3D TV or plan to get one in the future then get this version. The 3D is amazing.

That's partially due to a crushing lack of Tommy Lee Jones, who's relegated to a mere cameo appearance, but more thoroughly to a lack of conviction and casual, happenstance tone. It's okay for a comedy to be this thoroughly jokey and loose, but the formula that worked for this franchise in the past was a tight balance of those lighter moments with sharp, dramatic action sets. MIB3 may go through those motions, but the emotional punch that its predecessor had delivered so easily is almost completely absent here. Though the vast majority of the film is set in the free love sixties, the atmosphere also remains very modern, like attending a themed costume party where the host didn't get the memo. Excepting a few very easy sight gags and the eyeball-rolling location of the film's grand climax, this just doesn't seem to make much effort to ground itself in that era. Josh Brolin works an uncanny Jones impression during these scenes, but that act falls strangely flat when the real deal himself was on-screen only moments before, and in this case there's really no substitute for the real thing. Quirky and fun, but terribly thin and uncertain... worth watching for the effects and frequent nods to its genre-mates, but it's really no better than the underwhelming Men in Black II.\",\n",

Turner), and Amera (J'Nara Corbin), all of whom are struggling with romantic issues of one kind or another. Added into the mix is toxic Jay, Greg's unwelcome roommate, played by Maurice Murrell.Murrell, of course, died suddenly earlier this year, aged just 32, so it's nice to be able to report he's one of the best things in this film - shamelessly stealing every scene as a poisonous bad boy bent on taking everyone in his path down with him.Moore is cute as pretty boy toy Faybien and, when he's given enough to do (blowing his top with Jay comes to mind), proves he can act. Corbin's Amera grates, however: she shrieks her way through the movie, bulldozing her way through every scene like a drunk drag queen in a funeral parlour. It's supposed to be funny, but every appearance has the same effect as fingernails on a blackboard. Dial it down next time - sometimes, less is more.The film's producers have decided a revenge attack on whitey is the best way to make up for lack of black visibility in gay cinema: The two white characters who appear are deliberately distasteful, particularly Jay's friend Neal. Intriguing that each and every one of the black actors are (more or less) dazzlingly attractive, whilst Neal is a nasty queen who looks like an anemic weasel. God bless separatist America and all who sail in her!Still, it falls to Neal to deliver one of the movie's most apt lines. I feel like I'm watching three different TV shows, he remarks during a disastrous dinner party. You are, Neal, and they all air in the daytime. This isn't cutting edge, arthouse cinema. It's not even mainstream cinema. It's sub-Noah's Arc soap, of the E. Lynn Harris variety, and pretty clumsy soap at that (the dinner party scene is the most idiotic, ill-conceived deus ex machina you're likely to see in a film).If endless deliberations about feelings and relationships are your bag, this is for you. Just don't take it too seriously: watch with friends, plenty of alcohol, and enjoy the cute boys. But really: gay cinema - and black gay cinema - can be so much better than this.\",\n",

              "       \"Dealing with a low-brow subject, treating it to an outlandish and tasteless staging, with crude language and bad-taste humour, there is a danger that Anna Nicole, an opera by Mark Anthony Turnage about the former Playboy model who died of a drug overdose in 2007, could be accused of making Eurotrash out of American Trash, but the language and the staging befits the tone of its subject.  The barrage of rhyming couplets in the libretto from Richard Thomas (Jerry Springer the Opera) may clearly signal their intention to rhyme at the end with four-letter words and other mildly shocking profanities, but at the same time there is wit and pathos here in a libretto that actually manages to cut through the niceties directly to harsh crude reality of the circumstances of Anna Nicole Smith's life, unpalatable though that might be to the average opera-going audience.  Benjamin Britten and particularly Billy Budd comes to mind in the use of language, in its subject - which is also about a kind of loss of innocence on a bigger level than just the personal - and in Turnage's score, which also adopts his usual jazz and American influences, successfully finding the right tone for each occasion.The colourful, tastefully tacky set-designs by Richard Jones also adopt the right tone with plenty of eye-catching sights not commonly seen in an opera house, including a sequence in a lap-dancing parlour replete with artificial breast-enhanced women twirling themselves gymnastically and provocatively from poles.  The decision to present the opera as if it were a reality-TV show in which a chorus of TV hosts interview Anna Nicole, already dead but looking back over her life and tracing the path from smalltown girl to media celebrity that will ultimately lead to her destruction, is a masterstroke and it imbues the piece with a slightly sinister edge that grows as the opera proceeds.  The tone darkens considerably by the second half, when it does indeed become a tragedy, as the people in Smith's life disappear to be replaced by masses of ominous black figures with TV cameras for heads.Antonio Pappano, conducting the orchestra of the Royal Opera House, does well to allow the music score to assert its presence and not be overshadowed by the spectacle or the libretto.  Eva-Maria Westbroek is marvellous in the title role, and well supported by Gerald Finlay and Alan Oke.  As a Wagnerian soprano, Westbroek is however not really tested by the limited singing demands of the role, but she sings exceptionally well and manages to bring out the inherent humanity of her character, never letting her be merely an icon, nor indeed, allowing the performance to descend into parody.  Whether the opera ultimately has anything new to say or whether it touches on anything deeper in its subject - if indeed there anything deeper to be drawn from its subject - is questionable, but Anna Nicole demonstrates nonetheless that opera can still be a vital artform to address contemporary subjects in a powerful manner that can connect with a modern audience.On Blu-ray from Opus Arte, the opera - opening with a legal disclaimer that it is not intended to be an actual factual depiction of any person - looks every bit as bold as it should, the striking colours deeply saturated, with strong blacks and contrasts, and a good level of detail.  This often looks just stunning, and it is well filmed, picking out the singers at the right moments, while also allowing the overall impact of the set to be appreciated.  The audio tracks in PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 are also effective in allowing the detail of the musical arrangements to come through.  Subtitles are in English (so you can check that they actually sang what you thought they sang but couldn't quite believe), French, German and Spanish.  Aside from a Cast Gallery, the only other extra on the disc is a brief Production Report (8:25), introduced by Pappano, which nonetheless covers the development of the opera well with interviews with Turnage, Thomas and Westbroek.\",\n",

There's some B plot about a terrorist-slash-bad guy after them that wouldn't even pass for a filler episode of CSI. The script borrows heavily from True Lies but fails to copy the good parts that make it work, leaving us with a film that lurches violently from shooting five guys at point blank range to soppy scenes with The Witherspoon. In the midst of this, her character spends the entire film pondering the dilemma of dating two guys while her exposition sidekick Chelsea Handler gives her someone to talk to.Anyone who really works for the CIA must roll their eyes when they see poorly researched and frankly unbelievable nonsense like this. If you think the Secret Service's call girl incident in Colombia was bad, a single day in McG's intelligence agency involves wiretapping people you date, starting shootouts in Hong Kong and basically doing anything but your job (all Angela Bassett's watch, too).

What was once humorous has degraded into old fashioned sexism and over-used clich&eacute;s. Seriously, since when did anyone laugh at Masuka's jokes? He was a creep and his creepy humor was used to show how others perceived him and differentiated their integrity from his vulgar wit - a subtlety that flew over the heads of the new writers.The actors all seem to be on autopilot as if they are sleep walking through their lines - They can't even act excited to be stuck with all these bad lines.The show got itself stuck in a desperate cycle of having a guest start serial killer, unable to break free and try something new, the show circles through this now all too familiar ground.

Along the way there's a bar fights, flying horses, trespassing on distant lands, long treks up glacial mountain tops, snow sprites and ferocious Frost sentries, leagues of Amazonian maiden warriors, a flaming sword, an avenging Dark Elf and armies marching upon the grounds of Asgard.I don't miss the Thor of the comic book pages, this is like an illustrated page from The Lord of The Rings with all of the pomp and adventure.In addition to this hour and fifteen minute movie is a fascinating documentary on the Making of.This is a great introduction to the comic book hero, but unfortunately it's so good that any other Thor has to be reworked in light of it.THOR: TALES OF ASGARD, 5 very, very big stars.\",\n",

              "       \"JEWS AND BASEBALL: AN AMERICAN LOVE STORY is not only a documentary about Jews and baseball, it's about our national pastime generally, and how Jewish-Americans helped make it a sport for ALL Americans. Indeed, the music for Take Me Out To The Ballgame was written by a Jewish composer. The film briefly discusses Jewish baseball magnates like Bud Selig, Fred Wilpon, and others, but most of this documentary is concerned with on-field exploits.There has always been a certain low humor about Jews in sports. The film opens with a scene from the movie AIRPLANE, in which Julie Hagerty is handing a passenger 'light reading,' a leaflet on Great Jewish Sports Legends.A joke I remember from Hebrew School tells us that baseball is the first thing mentioned in the Bible: In the Big Inning God created the heaven and the earth. Exactly when and where God created baseball is not known, legends of Abner Doubleday and Cooperstown aside, but what is well known is that successive groups of immigrant fans and players adopted baseball as their sport and passport to Americanization.Jews were part of baseball from the very outset of league professional play. L. Emanuel Pike of the Philadelphia Athletics was on the first salaried team in 1871, and may have been the first great home run hitter of the sport, hitting six a year for three straight years during the Dead Ball Era.Between the 1870s and the 1930s, a workmanlike succession of  Jewish players followed Pike. Most were named Cohen and most used pseudonyms. It was not until the 1930s that a Jewish superstar emerged---Hammerin' Hank Greenberg of the Detroit Tigers who was to become the first Jewish player inducted into the Hall of Fame. Greenberg nearly matched Babe Ruth's and Lou Gehrig's hitting records; indeed, he may well have surpassed them but for the fact that Greenberg's career was interrupted by World War II. He had truncated 1940 and 1945 seasons and did not play at all in 1941, 1942, 1943, and 1944.  A focus of much verbal abuse by hayseed fans and players, Greenberg let his bat do most of his talking. He saw every hit he got as a swat at Hitler. But he never let his bat talk on Yom Kippur.Greenberg's career is the fulcrum of the film. Prior to Hank Greenberg, an athletic Jew was seen both as a person who perforce had to hide his identity in order to play, as well as being a freak of nature. After Greenberg, players named Al Rosen, Cal Abrams, Moe Berg and Sandy Koufax began to fill out Major League rosters.The Brooklyn Dodgers' signing of Jackie Robinson in 1947 is examined from a Jewish perspective by a rabbi who is also a rabid fan.The Dodgers' Sandy Koufax, the second Jewish Hall-of-Famer and possibly the greatest pitcher of all time, is portrayed as the spiritual successor to Greenberg and as the player whose career normatized the presence of Jewish players on the field. Those who have come after Koufax, like Shawn Green and Kevin Youkilis, still see themselves as representatives of the American Jewish community, but they are no longer subject, as Greenberg was, to ethnic abuse. Nor are they seen as oddities. Many fans are unaware that they are Jewish. They simply are talented Major Leaguers. And that is as it should be.The Extras focus almost exclusively on Sandy Koufax, a shy man who has been coaxed before the cameras for this DVD. There is also lounge singer Sophie Millman's jazzy rendition of Take Me Out To The Ballgame. Her silky voice is offset by some minor but noticeable lapses in timing. She sings like Koufax pitched as a rookie.A fun documentary, this is a must-have not just for those of us who are Jewish, but for all baseball fans.\",\n",

It is a disturbing movie to watch, a film that was condemned by the Russian government, disallowing filming in Moscow - except for some undercover camera work for an apparent Coca-Cola commercial, and refusing to allow Russian actors to take part in the project.  It reveals the brutality of the Communist regime of the time, a period Russia would prefer to remain occultThe story is somewhat convoluted, a fact that makes it even more revealing of the nature of espionage work at the time.  Sergei Gregoriev (Emir Kusturica) passes secret documents to French spy Pierre Froment (Guillaume Canet) living in Moscow with his wife (Alexandra Maria Lara), documents so important that Froment must take extraordinary risks to pass them to the US Government.  In the US President Reagan (Fred Ward) must balance the importance of these documents with the balance of relationships with the French government under Franois Mitterrand (Philippe Magnan)  it is a tense struggle for power and at the crux of it is Froment and the ultimately captured Gregoriev who is tortured to reveal his French espionage contact.  The rush to finish at the end of the film is breathtaking and heartbreaking. There is a conversation between Froment and the US Feeney (Willem Dafoe) that places the soul of the Cold War years in perspective.Every aspect of this film is involving - the acting is first rate from everyone involved, the pacing is in the fashion edge of the seat direction, and the sharing of the innermost secrets of espionage is information we all should study.  A reenactment of the Reagan/Gorbachev era as well defined as any film has dared to show us.  Not only is this excellent filmmaking, but it is also information about a man's (Sergei Gregoriev) sacrifice that deserve honor.  Grady Harp, April 11\",\n",

The assignment is to visit and report on a tour of some of the country's most respected, if remote, eateries.  When Steve Coogan first accepts the journalism job, he imagines it as a perfect getaway with his pretty girlfriend.  But at the last minute, she backs out and Coogan invites his best friend (and source of endless irritation) the happily married, new father, Rob Brydon.These two real friends -- yes, the two gifted actors and funnymen are actual rivals of a sort, as are all actors -- embark on a road trip that allows them to riff on all kinds of things from fame to fatherhood to food.  But it's the incredibly sublime impersonations that charge this slightly unhinged duo's increasingly intense arguments over -- of all things -- the proper vocalization of Michael Caine's inimitable and distinctive voice.  What makes it deliriously funny is both Coogan and Brydon will not let go of the one-upmanship or the criticism of the other's Caine impression.  The dissect changing vocal minutia during different aspects of Caine's career -- and then each man offers ever more hilariously accurate intonations of Caine's shifting tones and accents in various vintage and recent films.  There were moments when I could hardly catch my breath.  This is a smart, literate comedy.

A husband, wife and teenaged daughter move into a a very upscale house in a Madrid suburb. Their first night three men break into the house and take them hostage. They're going to fleece the place and get dad to take as much money out of the ATM as possible and then the bank the following day. Things go wrong.This is directed well. I did feel as though I were witnessing something. There was a naturalness to the directing that made me feel as though I were there. Some commented on the extreme violence but to me, it wasn't until the last 90 seconds or so that I really felt uncomfortable. During much of it the violence was fairly run of the mill. The story itself was pedestrian. The bad guys come. They overact to make everyone frightened. But, of course, unexpected things happen and they need to adapt. Nothing really happens that you might not have already seen in other similar movies. The near escapes. The missteps by the hostages that , once failed, make the hostages plead for their lives. This isn't new. There is some hope and some good things happen for the hostages. But then the end comes and it really made me want to spit. This film doesn't end. It stops. And it stops in the ugliest way possible.This is a solid effort. It is handled well and it's worth the time to view it. Just don't expect anything too out of the norm.\",\n",

              "       \"Available previously only through viewing at MOMA in a battered workprint, THE LETTER is one of those revelations in classic film that compels you to reevaluate how one looks at acting and performance in the early talkie era.  Mythologized as extremely stagy and with rolling diction and round tones, (see SINGIN' IN THE RAIN for examples of this) there would be the occasional film from that era that does not fall into that trap.  True, there are performances in this film (Reginald Owen, O. P. Heggie) that do perpetuate the stereotype, but Herbert Marshall (in his U. S. debut) and especially Jeanne Eagels most assuredly do not.That Eagels was even nominated for Best Actress for this film was a small miracle, considering that she passed away between the time of the film's release and the Oscars announcement.  That she lost to Mary Pickford, that era's female superstar and married to Academy president Douglas Fairbanks at the time, is not surprising, considering all the campaigning she did with Academy members in private beforehand.  But to compare both performances, Eagels leaves Pickford in the dust, as does the film (COQUETTE is one of Pickford's worst films, hands down, and her win is one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in the history of the Academy), and that we now have Eagels' performance to watch whenever we want is one of the best movie moments of 2011.This is a full-out, ballsy performance that I can only compare to Heath Ledger in THE DARK KNIGHT (sadly, another performance that, posthumously in this case won an award).  Both are not afraid to portray a character that you cannot like and who have no remorse, but both Eagels and Ledger appear to have approached their roles without a net and just became the characters and the results are breathtaking, to say the least.  They come within a whisker of overdoing it but the passion of both sells what they are doing so that when it is over, your mouth is hanging open with wonder and you just cannot believe what you have just seen-it is that good.  It is like you have never seen that actor before and the character has just slapped you in the face.  You can also tell this was made before the Production Code was enforced-Eagels proudly proclaims that she still is in love with the man she killed, and that is where the film ends!  By 1940, the character had to pay for what she did, and with her life.This version was supposed to be included with the Bette Davis version when that came out on DVD a few years ago-it was so disappointing to see it left off.  Thank the movie gods that Warner Archive has finally made it available to us.  The image quality is a bit rough-they were working off the only existing 35mm nitrate print-but Eagels shines through.

And the straw man has become something of an institution in creepy scares. I'm not sure when it happened or why, but these films now make up a sub-genre of the horror movie catalog. If you are looking for a presentation that brings a completely unique spin to the age old concept--Husk may not be your first choice in viewing entertainment. It is, however, a solidly constructed and surprisingly well acted entry in the field (the cornfield!). More concerned with establishing a malevolent mood, Husk works well enough as a suspense thriller which is sold by the actors involved. Note that I'm referencing it as a thriller, though, because this will not satisfy your bloodlust if you're looking for an all-out gore feast. Relatively mild in the splatter department, this works better as a character driven chiller.Initially, we meet a carload of five young and attractive vacationers. A couple of minutes of banter is quickly interrupted by a splattering of crows on the windshield causing the car to end up in a ditch. As the friends awake from the collision, one of them seems to have wandered off. Before you can say who's got a cell phone? (no one apparently), the group sets off with two of the remaining four crossing the cornfield to locate the ominous looking house in the distance. Havoc ensues as mysterious forces in the grain begin to stalk (corn stalk) the interlopers. Something is killing people and it's turning them into murderous scarecrows! My favorite part of this scenario is that once someone has been drafted into the undead league, they must go to the house to stitch up their own after-death costume. I've truly never seen zombie-like personages working a sewing machine, but what a practical way to make them earn their stripes!Through visions, we see the back story explaining the beginnings of these grisly happenings--but it adds little to the tale. It is the present, where each kid must face their own mortality, that is the primary selling point of Husk. The film is obviously well made, but its greatest asset is the cast. Very sincerely, they sell this hokum better than you have any right to expect and so the film does work on its own merits. C.J. Thomason and Wes Chatham, in particular, do well battling for the alpha male position. Both bring a pleasing intensity that actually drew me in. I loved the finale, as well. This brief eighty minute sojourn into the cornfield isn't revolutionary new horror, but it is certainly not without its pleasures. About 3 1/2 stars for me--I think the film accomplishes its goals--and I fully expect to see some of the actors graduate to bigger projects. KGHarris, 2/11.\",\n",

If PARIAH is indicative of the quality of films she will create, then we are in for a new level of verismo cinema. She tackles a tough subject - same sex relationships among African American women - with such insight and care to details that her film jumps off the screen screaming as in the words of her heroine `I'm not running - I'm choosing': lesbian girls are not God's mistake (to quote the mother figure) but instead have the courage to accept their difference and embrace their sexuality and still become successful members of society.Alike/Lee (Adepero Oduye, a fine young actress who hails from Brooklyn by way of Nigeria, a graduate of Cornell University who has studied acting with Wynn Handman, Austin Pendleton, and Susan Batson) is a 17-year old sexually conflicted girl who lives in Brooklyn with her younger very bright sister Sharonda (Sahra Mellesse) and her parents - police detective father Arthur (Charles Parnell) and conservative, overprotective, biased mother Audrey (Kim Wayans). Alike is an excellent student, a blossoming poet, and a lesbian: she maintains tow life styles complete with clothes changes so that she can be the `daughter' at home and herself outside the home. Alike's best friend Laure (Pernell Walker) is her support system as Laure is comfortable about being out as a lesbian. Alike's home life is strained as her ever arguing parents disagree on many factors, on of them being Alike's need to appear like a man. Audrey arranges for Alike to become friends with Bina (Aasha Davis) who is the daughter of one of Audrey's friends, an encouragement that eventually leads to Alike's surprise first sexual experience with a girl who is just `doing her own thing' - ie, not a lesbian. This deeply affects Alike, she delves more deeply into her poetry and graduates early because of her shining school record. At a point of no return she is confronted by her parents and the manner in which she makes her decision as to `run or choose' provides the ending of the story.The cast is uniformly strong and though Adepero Oduye makes a show-stopping debut, the other actors are equally superb. Bradford Young is the cinematographer who helps create the atmosphere. The dialogue is delivered in street language and is often covered with shouting and with multiple characters talking simultaneously: subtitles help here. But the genius of the film is in the concept and the courage and in the amazing gift for creating meaning cinema that comes across as the work of Dee Rees.  She is a talent to watch.

Also, sometimes the film seems to be telling a story involving Catholic theology, but other times, like the song When You Can See Forever, it seems to be more meology.

              "array([\"The rhythm of the Blues is birthed down and dirty like Georgia clay or Mississippi mud. It is where the musician's feet seek out the surface to beat against which matches the cadence of the emotional flow that first quickens the heart to react discordantly to the pain of love gone wrong. As Son House, legendary blues singer and guitarist, tells us: I'm talkin' about the Blues... When two people, supposed to be in love, when one or the other deceives the other through their love... It starts with a wail, a scream, a guttural cry from the throat of a seasoned songster or, maybe a saxophone will tell that part, and next the story behind it all is laid out in spades. Then, we cry. The Blues. There is nothing better on earth by which to heal a broken heart, whether that broken heart be from a failed marriage, loss of a loved one, a broken friendship for no good reason under the sun... All loss is like death, and listening to the blues is like having someone, even a stranger we just met at P.K.'s Place, who understands our innermost feelings sit right alongside us to grieve them to the ground.What 'Black Snake Moan', the movie, does is move us deeper to explore the underbelly of pain. It exposes the sheer ugliness of it, a portion of the malevolence of that which causes it and then it tears off the veil of the lie that says it can go away if you just want it bad enough. Moreover, it does not devalue the persons who experience pain and its effects. Is their (Rae and Ronny's) plight hopeless? Who knows? There has to be hope or let us just grant every nation permission to push the big red button that will allow us our collective journey to stand before our Maker. The fact that Laz reached out to help while mired deep in the newness of his own blues tune added a redemptive note. How beautiful with that gospel tone insinuated into his own despondent melodia. And, finally, the key to that redemption in the tone of black - sharp, but steady on. He found this ivory skinned doll, laid flat and damaged and then chose to take her in and let the melody of his father soul fuse with that of the child and ... well, you'll just have to see.Samuel Jackson and Christina Ricci are two very fine actors and this movie is great for their contribution. S. Epatha Merkerson is an excellent addition to anything she is involved in, and this is no exception. While Justin Timerberlake may not possess finely honed acting skills at the point of this movie, what I saw in 'Social Network' certainly shows steady, quality growth. For crying out loud! He started out in a boy band, and now he's in an Academy Award winning movie. He's no slouch.Another aspect that makes this movie work is the combination of gritty country scenery and great Blues music. The fact that Samuel Jackson can hold his own on a song is certainly a benefit. Overall the whole piece is something this director can be proud of and I can't wait to see what else he comes up with. Craig Brewer would be an interesting man to have a conversation with considering his mind and heart wrote of the spiritual aspects built into the hard living, tough talking lives of these characters who still looked to their God. Very authentic.\",\n",
              "       \"Jet Li had been kickin' arse and takin' names long before he played the scary Big Bad in LETHAL WEAPON 4, but it's exactly that gig that got him his first lead in a Hollywood action picture. ROMEO MUST DIE is self-described as a hip hop kung fu movie, as apt a description as any. This flick has got one overriding flaw, but mostly it's entertaining as heck.Shakespeare's classic tragedy is given that urban flavor and that martial arts twist. The story's backdrop concerns the blood feud between two ill-fated houses in Verona... er, Oakland, California. When word of his brother's murder in Oakland reaches an incarcerated ex-policeman named Han Sing (Jet Li), he promptly breaks out of his Hong Kong prison and makes his way to the U.S. There, he has a chance meeting with the beautiful Trish O'Day (Aaliyah), daughter of the local mob boss. Circumstances play out and we learn that Han is the son of an Asian crime family engaged in a turf war against the O'Day syndicate. It doesn't stop Han and Trish from becoming good friends.Aaliyah and Jet Li demonstrate this sweet, oddball chemistry, although I don't know that they made that convincing a romantic couple. It seems more like what they share is a platonic relationship. Aaliyah lights up the screen in her film debut, and I still get sad whenever I think of that plane crash. But you watch her in this movie and you can tell she's got what it takes. The supporting cast has her back. Delroy Lindo lends weight and credibility as the head of the O'Day mob. Russell Wong - whom I really liked in those VANISHING SON television films - plays the right hand man to the Asian Mafia's boss. Bow down to Russell Wong's good looks. He always seems to get these roles that call for someone sleek and sophisticated, and Russell always looks as cool as the other side of the pillow. His character is Han's longtime friend, but time apart can inflict changes in a friendship. With friends and loved ones from both crime families being targeted, who can be trusted? If you gaze at the unctuous Isaiah Washington - who plays O'Day's right hand man - and your eyes don't naturally narrow with suspicion, then you're not reading the signals too well. Look to your own houses, gangstas.It ticks me off a bit that it took until LETHAL WEAPON 4 before people here got wise to Jet Li and what he brings. Because his Hong Kong martial arts films are epic stuff. Here he shows off his kung fu, and jacks up a horde of western thugs. He even indulges in a rough game of football at the park. Anthony Anderson - who as Trish's undesired bodyguard provides the film's comedy relief - gets repeatedly beat up by Jet. The action set pieces are pretty good, except that they're undermined by the overzealous wire-fu. Some of the crazy moves that Jet and Russell Wong pull just look unconvincing, and this affected how much I enjoyed the film. Anyway, this soup of hip hop and martial arts worked well enough that the formula was recycled three years later for CRADLE 2 THE GRAVE, a film which also reunited Jet Li, Anthony Anderson, and DMX (who has a cameo in ROMEO MUST DIE as a club owner).The DVD's bonus stuff is thick with short documentaries:- HBO First Look Special: the Making Of ROMEO MUST DIE featurette (00:14:49 minutes long)- Inside the Visual Effects Process - about the ultra pain mode f/x which occasionally pops up in the movie; the ultra pain mode is a digitally-rendered x-ray vision sequence which depicts the internal damage Jet inflicts on his antagonist (00:03:50)- Diary of a (Legal) Mad Bomber - about the film's practical effects (00:04:50)- Anatomy of a Stunt - with professional stunt woman Melissa Stubbs as she performs a descender drop from a highrise, a high fall, and a fall right into the drink; this is a pretty cool featurette accompanied by pop up trivia (00:06:50)- The Sound Stage - about the film's sound mix, that which provides balanced levels of dialogue, special sound effects, and score (00:01:32)- Stairway Dance - behind the scenes at filming Jet's stairway tussle (00:01:34)- Kung Fu Football - shooting the football at the park sequence (00:02:36)- A Benz, a Bike, a Babe and Some Badasss Kung Fu - behind-the-scenes of the 4-minute car chase and Jet & Aaliyah's dance-fu (00:03:44)- The Hose - shooting the scene where Jet uses a fire hose as a weapon (00:02:48)- Master on Fire - shooting the climactic fight scene between Han and Kai (00:02:22)- Jet Li is 'Han' - an interview with Jet as he talks about the film (00:03:33)- Aaliyah is 'Trish' - an interview with Aaliyah (00:05:01)- Anthony Anderson is 'Maurice' aka 'Moron' - an interview with Anthony  (00:02:58)- 2 music videos - Aaliyah's Come Back in One Piece featuring DMX and Try Again featuring Jet Li- the Making Of Aaliyah's Try Again music video (00:04:14)- Cast & Crew credits & filmographies- ROMEO MUST DIE theatrical & international trailers\",\n",

If you do have that extra quality, then by all means, there's hope for you to enjoy The Hangover.The Hangover is an absolutely hilarious film starring Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Justin Bartha, Heather Graham, Sasha Barrese, Ken Jeong, Rachael Harris, Mike Tyson, Mike Epps, and others; about 4 guys who go to Las Vegas and end up having the ultimate time of their lives.  Only bad thing is they can't remember a damn thing and have to figure out what the heck happened.  This film is the perfect nightmare I've had most of my life that keeps me from going to Las Vegas.  Absurdity abounds and comedy is non-stop.  You can't help yourself and start laughing about fifteen minutes in, and then you just keep on laughing all the way to the end.  There is a sequel planned, and I'm going to get it, too.  Do yourself a favor and own this DVD.  Heather Graham was my favorite character BTW.  Good grief this DVD is a great choice IMHO.\",\n",

              "       \"The original cut is, in my opinion, a modern classic, and certainly the best film made by the Coen Brothers. Its grainy, B-movie aesthetic is absolutely fascinating to watch, as much fun as it is seeing the Coen Brothers coax every once of talent out of their colorful cast, be it Dan Hedaya (&#34;Commando&#34;), M. Emmet Walsh (&#34;Blade Runner&#34;), Frances McDormand (&#34;Miller's Crossing&#34;), or John Getz (Cronenberg's &#34;The Fly&#34;). These characters, perhaps lifted from the pages of the now forgotten crime and strange stories pulp magazines of yesterday, come off of the screen with intensity, anger, and authenticity. Seriously Joel and Ethan--what went wrong guys? In the early days they seemed to be taking things a bit more seriously (perhaps they were hungry?), proving themselves to be adequate readers of human nature, and not the jocular fiends responsible for the content in &#34;Fargo&#34; and &#34;Burn After Reading&#34; (or, as I like to call it, &#34;Burn After Viewing&#34;). With &#34;Fargo&#34; they took a turn for making even stronger anti-American films with extremely insulting characterizations, but in 1985 they had it together. I suspect that Joel spending a year in the dark room with Raimi's &#34;The Evil Dead&#34; must have given him the fortitude (and temperament) for directing a film more along the lines of a horror thriller as opposed to a style with the monstrous post-modernism of the utterly depressing &#34;Barton Fink&#34; for example.I prefer the VHS copy to viewing the newer releases, so that it is the title I have chosen to review.

            "[\"T obe clear, this is a review ofThe Walking Dead:  Season One [Blu-ray]. This includes, but is not limited to the series itself but also the actual technical aspects of the Blu Ray release.The Walking Dead is a small screen adaptation of an ongoing comic book series by the same name. You can find the first part of the series collected inThe Walking Dead:  Compendium One.The story goes that a sheriff's deputy is taken to the hospital after being shot by criminals. When he awakens quite some time seems to have passed and the hospital is empty... with the exception of some dead people and a door with a very odd warning. The series involves Rick trying to reunite with his wife and son while avoiding being bitten by the walking dead. Eventually he hooks up with other survivors, getting ever closer to just what is going on.From what I understand, the TV series takes some liberties with the original comic books story, but tries to remain as true as possible to the source. I have not read the books, so I cannot accurately tell you whether this is fact or not. I'm sure there is at least one website that will compare the two in detail.From a Blu Ray perspective, I have to say that AMC, through Anchor Bay, has really put together a fantastic looking, and sounding collection for this first season.Video-Filmed in 1080p at 24 frames per second, the Blu Ray is encoded at the same resolution and frame rate using the AVC codec. Some scenes contain a bit of grain, usually outdoors shots and I believe this would be as intended by the director and producers. Since I believe this series was done with digital video cameras and equipment, the image is vivid, bright and full of detail. Finally seeing this in 1080p, when the TV airing was at 720p, you can really see more detail.Audio-The Blu Ray is encoded using Dolby Digital TrueHD. Compared to watching this on TV, in standard stereo, it's a subtle but noticeable difference. The higher quality also lets you hear details either missing or stifled by the TV format such as cicadas or crickets when Rick first exits the hospital that were barely audible on TV.Directionality is good, but as the series was filmed specifically for TV, and not everyone has their TV setup in a surround sound situation, there really isn't a ton going on in the rear sound stage. Dialog is front and center and nothing of any importance to the plot is heard strictly in the rear channels. Gunshots, zombie shuffling and other sound effects are all that happens in the rears. This is expected but slightly disappointing none the less.Packaging-Two discs with distinct artwork on each. The Blu Ray case has a slip cover, which is nice but unnecessary. Typical blu case with the two discs on either side of the open case. An insert in the case has the same artwork as the cover and on the flip side has a handy sheet for how to figure out if someone is a walker.Extras-Making of the series, inside the series, sneak preview for season 2, make-up tips and convention footage where the show was debuted if memory serves.Also included is some bonus footage, which is nice but nothing amazing.Over all, there is nothing truly amazing about the extras but they are good enough to watch at least once.If you are a fan of horror movies and zombies, you'll probably enjoy this one. The only issue I can see for someone who is coming to the series for blood and guts and horror, you're likely to be disappointed. I would say The Walking Dead is more a narrative about a man looking for and protecting his family, and the zombies are simply a plot vehicle to get you there. That's not totally true, but fits the series.This is a great release for a great series. 5 stars without question and I hope they offer similar quality when season 2 is released on Blu Ray.\"\n",
            " \"Road House is one of those movies that has an almost cult-like following.  Everyone I know who loves this movie, including me, can watch it over and over and over.All the leads are alpha males or females in their own way.  Dalton (Patrick Swayze) is quiet but explosive.  Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara) is snakey and manipulative.  Wade Garrett (Sam Elliott) is life wise and supremely confident.  Denise (Julie Michaels) is nasty and she knows it.  Doc (Kelly Lynch) is sexy, excessively tanned, and smarter than everyone.  And finally the town's business owners are calculating and determined.  Thankfully they all converge in the town of Jasper, home of the Double Duece Road House, for violence, sex, and some fun music.  What's not to love about this movie that gets cheesy'er and more enduring with each passing year?The Blu-ray version really adds SNAP to the flick with sharp images, great colors, and a room-filling DTS soundtrack.  Yeah, the hairstyles and clothes are almost laughable, but for those of us who were clubbing (or not too far removed) in 1989 the Road House is practically a trip down memory lane.Hey, for $8.99 new for the Blu-ray/DVD combo, how can you go wrong?  If is isn't that price when you read this review, be patient, it will be again.\"\n",
            " \"I have been a avid viewer of movies nominated for the Best Foreign Language Oscar.  They are generally a treasure chest of little-known but excellent and near-excellent films.  On the list for 1990 is Cyrano de Bergerac and I was tempted to skip this entry for several reasons.  First of all, I had seen the Jose Ferrer version and, to be honest, I don't recall a thing about that movie except that I thought it was rather boring.  Secondly, this film runs about two and a half hours which sounded to me like an additional 30 minutes of boredom.  Finally, I didn't care for the actor in the leading role; Gerard Depardieau.  Mind you, I've seen him in a number of other Oscar-nominated foreign language films but I always felt that the movies he was in were good despite him rather than because of him.  He's a big hulking guy that seems to stumble in many ways.  I now have changed my mind about Gerard because he was excellent in the role of the title character in Cyrano de Bergerac.Everything in Cyrano de Bergerac seems to have been done on a higher scale than most costume dramas.  The sets were outstanding along with the costumes, the direction and the acting.  I watched in fascination as I, for once, realized the magnitude of the play by Edmond Rostand.  Heck, reading the play (which I now intend to do) may come across as a let-down after seeing this movie version.  It has just about everything and the director, Jean-Paul Rappeneau, let's it all happen on a majestic scale.  The battle scenes were especially impressive and I got the impression that great research was done to show the life and customs of the era.  However, despite all these accolades, my top kudos go to Gerard Depardieau whose performance truly enhanced the quality of the film.  His bombastic nature was perfectly suited for the title role (or is it that Cyrano de Bergerac was perfectly suited for Gerard Depardieau?).  He may not be the greatest actor but he certainly is the greatest Cyrano de Bergerac.\"\n",

            " \"Released in 1993, Bruce Willis' &#34;Striking Distance&#34; has a bad reputation. Roger Ebert tore it to pieces, basically saying it was too derivative and by-the-numbers, and Willis himself said he hated it. After finally seeing it I can understand criticism to a point. The story has a very melodramatic comic-book vibe, which is obvious in the opening act, almost like a TV production except with a superior cast and action scenes. But -- and this is an important but -- I quickly found myself drawn into the story & the characters and greatly enjoyed the Pittsburgh locations, the (melo)drama and the thrills. In other words, the movie IS entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game.The story revolves around Tom Hardy (Willis), a Pittsburgh detective, who's demoted to police river rescue. A serial killer returns after a two-year absence and bodies of beautiful women start turning up in the river, all women whom Hardy used to date! Sarah Jessica Parker is on hand as Hardy's partner on the river.This is a cop thriller in the manner of the Dirty Harry series, except more comic booky and taking place in Pittsburgh rather than San Francisco. It's also reminiscent of films like &#34;The General's Daughter.&#34; Although not technically as good as the Dirty Harry movies or &#34;The General's Daughter&#34; due to the cartooniness, &#34;Striking Distance&#34; nevertheless pulled me into the lives of the characters and gave the requisite thrills. As such, I feel it's at least as good as some of the lesser Dirty Harry films.The generically-named &#34;Striking Distance&#34; was originally called &#34;Three Rivers&#34; -- a much better title simply because it's more specific -- but was changed at the last minute because the marketing department feared people would think it was a sports movie due to Three Rivers Stadium, so they switched it to &#34;Striking Distance.&#34; Why? The first hint is at the beginning of the move when the title card shows two electrical bolts coming out from either side of the title. Later we observe the mysterious killer using a stun gun before killing his victims and, with a stun gun, you must of course be within... striking distance!Speaking of the killer, one element of the plot I haven't mentioned is that this a whodunit. Someone is charged with being the killer early on but Hardy knows it's the wrong guy; in fact, he and others are sure it's a cop or ex-cop doing the killings. There are a few suspects, including Hardy himself, but -- I'll be honest with you -- I was unable to guess the right person. There's another twist late in the story that also took me by surprise.The bottom line is that &#34;Striking Distance&#34; is a cop thriller that effectively entertains and entertainment is the name of the game. Plus it was shot in Pittsburgh, a refreshing change.The film runs 102 minutes.GRADE: B\"\n",

There was no mention of the source of Mrs. Carter&#8217;s power and influence. Was she the owner of the only factory that provided employment for many of the townspeople? That explains power and influence in a small town. Many small towns depended on one big employer who wields influence of its employees lives. That is more important than the usual scandals of improper behavior. This is Hollywood&#8217;s view of small town life; was it realistic. Note there is little mention of any religious influence. Or the lack of television sets in those days. The dislike of Allison can be explained by the jealousy of other people (human nature).Who rules your town?'\n",
            " \"Liam Neeson has a way of speaking his lines and carrying himself that I like. I don't know where Liam is from but for some reason I like him as an actor. That said, this movie really doesn't offer much. I truly enjoyed the action part of the movie. I love how Neeson's character wasted no time in simply killing scumbags. That is the way I would do it, if I was put in such a situation or that is the way I would want to do it. Sure, in a real world you'd probably simply get killed in your first encounter with such dangerous scumbags. So it's nice to go to fantasy land where one guy can become an army of one. So, I really enjoyed the killing of scum but the rest of the movie was awful.Neeson's daughter in this movie is that gal who I loathed from the tv show LOST. Now granted, in LOST the actresses's part was supposed to be loathsome. So to that extent the actress played her part well in LOST. But in Taken we are supposed to believe the actress is a teenager, that she is worth saving and so on. I didn't find the character to be worth saving. The girl was living a new life with her wife's new husband. Neeson's character bought the daughter a Karaoke machine while the new sugar daddy bought his new daughter a horse. And the wife was quite loathsome as well. Why would this character who is cast as a loser even care about such people. And there was no chemistry between Neeson's character, his daughter and the ex-wife. The plot is so thin and everything is completely predictable. I never was at a loss for anything. Everything was laid out like a 200 thread count sheet. The plot was weak, weak, weak. The family was weak, weak, weak. It was just so obvious that the director was throwing up a family so they could get to the action scenes which were fun. And I don't know but perhaps Neeson is also to blame for the family stuff not working. Maybe a more accomplished actor could have made the family more believable but I didn't believe this so called family, or ex family for one minute. To me the family was just stage and prop. So I'm saying the movie has no depth. The movie was lame. What more can I say.\"]\n",

              "array([\"Ben Affleck's second directorial effort is based on the novel Prince of Thieves by Chuck Hogan, with a screenplay by Peter Craig, Affleck, and Aaron Stockard, who co-wrote the screenplay for Affleck's first filmGone Baby Gone. Taking place in Boston, an area which Affleck is quite familiar with, The Town is a heist movie that has been inevitably compared to Heat with few mentioning how it compares to recent ventures into the heist sub-genre. In comparison to most of the mindless, non-stop action heist movies that have been released in the last few years, The Town is a welcome return to the heist films that had both story and characters that were more than mere pawns of the screenplay. As a whole, The Town is a terrific, though imperfect film expertly handled by its unlikely director who has proven himself a worthy director with his two films.One blue-collar Boston neighborhood has produced more bank robbers and armored car thieves than anywhere in the world. Charlestown. While I can't testify to the accuracy of this, the film's opening title card sets the stage for what's in store and the opening scene puts us right into the middle of a bank robbery, where the robbers expertly infiltrate the bank and make off with the money and a hostage named Claire (Rebecca Hall). The robbers are lead by the level-headed Doug MacRay (Affleck), although commissioned and basically controlled by the florist, Fergie Colm (the late Pete Postlethwaite). The group is paranoid about the wild-card in their group James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), who was responsible for the kidnapping during the robbery and now may need to tie up loose ends when he finds that their hostage lives only a few blocks from them. With their latest job attracting the attention of the F.B.I. and the driven F.B.I. agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm), Doug offers to make sure the girl is not a threat. This sets up an unlikely relationship between the former hostage and her kidnapper.Whether you've been to Boston or not, it's clear that Affleck knows the rhythm and the language of the area very well and his Boston-setting is almost a character itself. While Affleck's acting career soured in the early 2000s due to a string of high-profile flops, it's clear this Boston setting he's in his element both as an actor and director. The Town is a dramatic heist film, certainly not the first of its kind, yet Affleck handles the material with both confidence and skill. With bits of drama, action, romance, and even some humor, Affleck handles these elements capably by establishing strong, distinct characters whose decisions seem natural and not just fueled by what the script requires of them. The heist sequences are tense, exciting, and intelligently executed without sacrificing the story and characters for mindless action. Even the exaggerated masks that are used lend to the tone established and make the scenes more memorable, despite not bringing anything new to the sub-genre. Making its setting such an integral part of the story would not succeed without a strong cast and Affleck has assembled a cast that elevates already strong material.Affleck and Renner, the latter of whom received a Best Supporting Oscar nomination for his role, brilliantly contrast each other with Renner playing a despicable psychopath allowing a more extroverted, attention-garnering role and Affleck playing the good-hearted, introverted role that tends to garner less acclaim. It's obvious that Affleck's ability as an actor has matured quite gracefully over the last few years and he proves to be an impressive force here. With what seems to be a renewed passion for his craft and the freedom to play by his own rules, he brings both depth and a disarming charm to his role as Doug. Displaying both confidence and vulnerability, he's presents himself as an actor ready to be taken seriously again. Meanwhile, Jeremy Renner manages to upstage nearly everyone with his great performance. A far cry from his role in The Hurt Locker that thrust him into recognition, Renner marvelously alternates between intensely charming and venomous, depending on what the moment calls for. His character is dangerous and unpredictable which Renner makes wholly believable while adding an acute sense of humanity as well. Few performances of this sort are as convincing as Renner's here; you wouldn't want to mess with him and you can see him ready to snap at any moment, yet you feel empathy for him as well. Hamm, Hall, Postlethwaite, Slaine, Blake Lively, and Chris Cooper all do some great work as well, making this a true ensemble effort. As an actor, Affleck knows how to work with actors and he gets impressive the best from all involved.Quite simply, The Town is fast-paced, very entertaining, and (best of all) well-made. It's not a masterpiece, although I'd be troubled to go on about its imperfections at any great length and Affleck is proving himself to be an impressive filmmaker who has crafted a heist film that stands alongside the few great/really good films of this genre. He tackles his film with passion, energy, and vision proving once-and-for-all that he's worth taking seriously and reassessing. The Town may not be his masterpiece, but it's got me excited for what he'll bring to the film world in the future.GRADE: B\",\n",
              "       \"There's not enough that can be said about the insane motivations of suicide bombers, but Hany Abu-Assad's powerful Paradise Now is the closest I have seen to this point. It's a sad account of two sad young men who have been brainwashed into thinking martyrdom will aid the cause of the cowards who decide their fate. When push comes to shove, they both have second thoughts, and the outcome is left to the imagination of the viewer; regardless, it's upsetting and usettling. The preciousness of life--ALL life--is examined, and the futility of it all is quite well addressed. Paradise Now is an excellent film on many levels. Aside from its profound subject matter and the fine direction, the acting from all is excellent, especially from our two lead characters,Sad (Kais Nashif) and Khaled (Ali Suliman). Filmed on location in the West Bank, production values are above average for an Indie film; generous close-ups are frequent, adding a very personal tone to the film. Though it's a small faction of Muslim unrest, one cannot deny that the suicide idea is to be dealt with, though I'm sure it will never be understood. I, personally, choose to praise a God who holds life as precious, not to randomly destroy it; to think of this world not as it is, but as it ought to be.\",\n",
              "       \"Vibrant, colorful, symbiotic and ambiguous, The Double Life of Veronique is a wonderful arthouse film that continues to resonate strongly 20-years later and a highlight in the career of Polish director and screenwriter Krzysztof Kie'lowski's cinema oeuvre.The Double Life of Veronique is a 1991 French and Polish film and a pre-cursor to Kieslowski's color trilogy (Three Colors: Blue, Red and White) and known for the TV mini-series The Decalogue which captured audiences for its artistic style, considering it was a TV mini-series, preceded by three more Kieslowski films that received rave reviews in 1988, A Short Film About Love,  A Shot Film About Killing and in 1981 for Blind Chance.The film won Best Actress, FIPRESCI Prize and Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the Cannes International Film Festival and was also nominated for a Golden Palm Award.  Also winning an award for Best Music by the Los Angeles Film Critics and Best Foreign Language Film by the National Society of Film Critics Awards.While the film was praised for its symbolic and artistic quality, for the US release, Harvey Weinstein of Miramax requested an alternate ending and thus the US version of the film had an extra four scenes at the end.But what The Double Life of Veronique would feature is a concept of doppelgangers, a fantasy element that is not explained but it is part of the film.  But what is amazing about the film is its cinematography as it uses color and camera filters to create an ethereal atmosphere where greens, yellows, oranges, reds and blacks are featured strongly throughout the film.  A style which cinematographer Slawomir Idziak would experiment on The Decalogue and would become used in this film and used heavily in Kieslowski's Color trilogy.VIDEO:The Double Life of Veronique is presented in 1:66:1 and looks magnificent on Blu-ray.  Detail is much more evident as you can see the cracks of the walls to the skin bumps on Irene Jacob's naked skin.  The colors also pop with no sight of banding.  Colors are vibrant, blacks are nice and deep. As mentioned earlier, the color filters and what was accomplished by cinematographer Slawomir Idziak is quite amazing.  The filters create an ethereal dreamlike look for the film and if you thought the film looked great on DVD, on Blu-ray, The Double Life of Veronique looks spectacular.On 4:3 televisions, the images will appear letterboxed.  On standard and widescreen televisions, black bars may also be visible on the left and right to maintain the proper screen format.According to the Criterion Collection, the HD transfer was created using a 35mm negative.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS system, while Digital Vision's DVNR system was used for small dirt, grain and noise reduction.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:The Double Life of Veronique is presented in stereo.  Dialogue and music can be heard clearly! The score by Zbigniew Preisner is wonderful and comes alive through the lossless stereo track but if anything captured me was hearing the operatic voice (not sure if that was truly Irene Jacob's voice but it was divine!).According to the Criterion Collection, the stereo soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the 35-mm magnetic tracks.

(Note: The Forced Choice of Freedom by Slavoj Zizek and Kieslowski's Muse by Peter Cowie which were in the 2006 DVD release booklet are not included in the Blu-ray release booklet).JUDGMENT CALL:The Double Life of Veronique is quite an intriguing film.  Many critics and viewers have various interpretations of the film... From the two women symbolizing their countries, the women symbolizing the life of Kie'lowski and others feeling it deals with the doppelganger mythology and more.There is an ambiguity that Kie'lowski knew that people who watched the film, would experience and interpret it differently.  And it's what he wanted to do as a filmmaker.  In fact, knowing that this film would be showing in various theaters, his goal was to slightly change the film for each theater,  The Double Life of Veronique would be a different experience for a viewer, with some scenes running shorter or longer, ending would be happy or sad but in the end, they ran out of time and were only able to create two versions, with the second version being the US release with a few scenes added to the request made by Miramax's Harvey Weinstein.There is no doubt that this is one of those films that arthouse fans love for its cinematic creativity.  The cinematography by Slawomir Idziak is magnificent.  The use of the filters in Kie'lowski's words, to create a beautiful world, more than it is.  But for others, the film may be too ambiguous for their tastes.  But it is what made Kie'lowski's work so unique and untethered.  Although he worked in co-productions, his films were his own.  He made the call, he made the cuts and the integrity of the film of what he wanted remained intact.But there are scenes that are symbolic, there are scenes which one must be focused on too pickup the various clues that Kie'lowski leaves with the viewers.  From Weronika pulling on a shoestring which resembles an EKG monitor and seeing the string snap off.  There is a scene in Veronique's storyline in which her small crystal ball shows an image of buildings which were the buildings that Weronika's father was drawing, and a small ball that Weronika also carries.  There is a scene where Weronika looks at her photo after making love and seeing the opposite with Veronique.The film showcases this mysterious connection but it doesn't focus on it.  While many Hollywood films on the mystical are treated with storylines answering questions of why is it possible?, Kie'lowski's film answers back with a why should I answer that?.In many ways, the film can be seen like poetry, like a painting.  The film relies on ambiance and mood for narrative, in fact Weronika/Veronique's dialogue is quite minimalistic, as the film is ethereal and allows the viewer to come up with their own answers to what the film may be about.I've met people who felt that Weronika succumbs to the doppelganger effect (a myth which is about a person who comes across their exact self, their doppelganger, the result is that they will die).  But there are those who go deeper into the storyline and feel that The Double Life of Veronique examines humanity and possibly may symbolize countries.  If both countries have a connection and are very much alike, do they have free will or is someone higher pulling their strings. Others have felt there was a religious connection (although God or religion is not mentioned in the film), I have read those who felt there was a Christian-link to the film when it comes to spirituality.Some may feel there is a symbolism with a political nature due to Kieslowski's past films, while others feel the film is about something deeper.  Nevertheless, this is where the efficacy of the film works, with the fact that people have their own interpretation of what the film is about and what they imagine the film to be.This was Kieslowski's style, to never discuss what he was trying to accomplish with the film, to let the viewers have their say on how a film meant to them.For me, I have watched this film several times and each time, I manage to pick up on things that I didn't see previously.  In fact, this is a film that does require multiple viewings, not for the sake of understanding the story but as I mentioned before, it's like a painting.  It has simplicity, but it can also be interpreted as complex.  Kie'lowski is the creator, does his past and what he had created in his past films or documentary work have something to say about his work of art?  What are the symbolic meanings of the objects of the film?  These questions is what makes the film so intriguing that you want to watch it again.As for the acting, the acting was wonderful.  Irene Jacob did a fantastic job in playing the role of two women.  She is able to embody the emotions felt by both women, from happiness, sadness and it looks natural and believable.  And I will say that if it that is Jacob's voice during those operatic scenes, my respect for her as a multi-talented actress has increased and found her performance to be ingratiating.As for the Blu-ray release of The Double Life of Veronique, let me first say that the 2006 DVD release from The Criterion Collection was magnificent.  And with the 2010 Blu-ray release in Europe ala Artificial Eye, there was no doubt in my mind that this title would receive a Blu-ray release courtesy of Criterion.  The 2011 Blu-ray looks absolutely beautiful in HD and of course, with the ability to go to index for the commentary quite easily is a plus.  But it is important for me to say that the original 2006 DVD release does have more content (in the booklet) and of course, the DVD release had an awesome package.So, the big question for those who own the previous 2006 DVD release is if it's worth owning on Blu-ray.  The answer is yes if you want the improved picture quality and lossless stereo track.  But if you don't have a 1080p HD TV or a proper home theater setup for lossless audio, then it's a moot point, there is no need to upgrade.  Otherwise, if you do have the proper home theater setup, then yes because the film looks absolutely vibrant on Blu-ray,  The details of the film are much more evident, every crack on the walls can be seen, even the skin bumps on actress Irene Jacob can be seen very clearly.Overall, The Double Life of Veronique is a magnificent film from director Krzysztof Kie'lowski and the Blu-ray release from The Criterion Collection is wonderful.  I will say that the original 2006 DVD had a wonderful package presentation and the addition of more content in the booklet made it a perfect release and if you own that DVD release, I highly recommend on keeping it.  But for those who don't own the film or those wanting to upgrade to Blu-ray, especially for those who are used to watching arthouse films, especially Kie'lowski films, will find The Double Life of Veronique to be a release worth owning especially as it is a film that requires multiple viewing.The Double Life of Veronique is a beautiful film!Highly recommended!\",\n",
              "       \"Morning Glory aspires to be the movie equivalent of a morning latte (a perky, frothy concoction), but it more closely resembles a shaken-up can of diet soda, as once all the fizz has dissolved, there is not much left to enjoy other than a few empty calories.  The heroine, Becky Fuller (a dynamic Rachel McAdams) is an ambitious young producer surprisingly given the opportunity to resurrect the long-ailing, 40-year old network morning news program, Daybreak.  With cantankerous new co-anchor Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford) to constantly babysit, relentlessly upbeat Becky (she's practically a human espresso machine) has her hands full reviving Daybreak while still trying to make time to fulfill other basic needs in her high-pressure, workaholic lifestyle.All in all, Morning Glory initially made me wonder if it could be a stellar 21st Century equivalent of I'll take on New York and win big movies like 1987's Secret of My Success and 1988's Working Girl.  The only problem is that this movie's minimal storyline probably would have worked better as an above-average TV movie rather than an inflated big-screen spotlight vehicle for Ms. McAdams.  Admirably, she performs just as well as other talented actresses, like Anne Hathaway, Kate Hudson, and Reese Witherspoon would have done with the same role.  Beyond McAdams, her best able support comes from Diane Keaton, as peppy (at least, on-air) co-anchor Colleen Peck.  Keaton has done better work elsewhere, but here she is spot on as an aging yet spry morning news personality willing to try almost anything to keep her jeopardized program afloat.  Further, John Pankow (as Becky's assistant), Jeff Goldblum (as her world-weary division chief), and Patti D'Arbanville (as Becky's mom) add some nice supporting performances.  Patrick Wilson, as Adam (Becky's love interest), does the best he can with a pretty clich&eacute;d role, but he is unable to add much glimmer to the tired plot.Unfortunately, even less could be said for co-lead Harrison Ford, who, in an all-too-ironic parallel to his grouchy on-screen alter ego, appears to know he is slumming here and his coasting performance clearly pays for it.  It is not all Ford's fault, as he was simply miscast probably for star power purposes.  Even cameos by real television anchors and an interview with Condoleeza Rice can't provide Ford with the necessary credibility to make viewers visualize his character as being up there with Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw.  The film instead really needed someone like Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, or William Shatner, who could have gleefully contributed the funny zip, zeal, or quirkiness to bring a pompous jerk like Pomeroy truly to life (after all, this movie is supposed to be a sparkly romantic comedy). Even another retread of the late Ted Knight's bombastic, self-important Ted Baxter persona would have likely worked here.The problems with Morning Glory can readily be captured by its underwhelming climax (during which Becky must choose between a revitalized Daybreak and another network's dream job) by demonstrating that some terrific little moments end up lost in a clich&eacute;d-driven finale.  If this flimsy script had been sent in for needed repairs early on, Morning Glory may well have been easily salvageable.  Otherwise, for Rachel McAdams fans, one should enjoy it as a preview of better works from her down the road.Rating: 6.5/10 (Watchable and undemanding, probably a nice date night choice).P.S.  Very little is provided on the special features, including only one deleted scene.  It only reinforces my suspicion that there wasn't much plot here to begin with.\",\n",
              "       \"When all is said and done, `Don't Say a Word' works.  It may not knock it out of the park, and you certainly won't be writing home to mother telling her that you've seen the greatest movie you've seen in your whole life; but even to that extent, you won't be thinking about this long enough to call your mother...and yet it's still a good flick and one that wouldn't be wasted on the viewer.Like many have mentioned (non as eloquently as Jeffrey Ellis), this film is very `by the numbers' and sometimes that is exactly what you want to see.  You don't need to think too hard with this one, and while the plot may become tired towards the end, it all works in the generalities it has created for itself.The film circles a moment in the life of Dr. Nathan R. Conrad, a psychiatrist whose life is flipped upside down when some creep kidnaps his daughter and demands that Conrad coerce a young patient to relay a number she has locked up in her head.  The problem is that this patient is very disturbed and getting her to open up is a struggle.Without the performances so in-tune with one another, this film would have lost interest fast, but Michael Douglas, Sean Bean, Brittany Murphy, Jennifer Esposito and Famka Janssen all pull their weight and then some here.  As has been noted, certain members of cast seem to be recycling variations of previous characters (especially Sean Bean, who is too good of an actor to be typecast so vigorously) but they all play their roles respectfully and at times even beautifully.  The late Brittany Murphy showed her range here, delving into the lunacy of her character with a vulnerable endearment.  It isn't as layered as her remarkable work in `Girl, Interrupted', but it works very well within the constraints of the film.Yes, `Don't Say a Word' can at times appear one-note in construction.  We all know who everyone is entirely the minute we see them and so the layers of a character that make them so interesting is missing, and the mystery surrounding the film doesn't seem so startling, but despite the flaws the film is still enjoyable and entertaining.Go ahead and watch it.\",\n",
              "       \"The Ghost Writer is the work of a true master. It is Roman Polanski's eighteenth film as a director, and it proves--if it needed further proving--that at age 77, he just as brilliant a filmmaker as he ever was. He has made one of his best films to date, a taut, pulse-pounding political thriller of Hitchcockian proportions that also contains echoes of his own films, particularly Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby.Ewan McGregor plays a nameless man whose past is left a mystery. He is hired by a publisher to ghost write ex-British Prime Minister Adam Lang's (Pierce Brosnan) memoirs. The previous ghost, a long time aid to Lang, was found dead, washed up along the beach near Lang's beach house in Martha's Vineyard, his car still on the crossing ferry. It is assumed that he was either drowned accidentally or committed suicide, but Polanski lets us know in more ways than one that it will probably not be that simple. The sense of foreboding that the director creates forms its grip on us from the opening shot, and never lets go for a second.Lang's beach house is a fortress of secrets surrounded by stormy, grey skies that constantly threaten to shed rain at any moment. The new ghost arrives and is welcomed by Lang's aid, Amelia (Kim Cattrall), who is also his mistress. This is no secret to Lang's wife, Ruth (Olivia Williams), a lonely but tough woman who is deeply detached from her husband.Just as the new ghost arrives, Lang who comes under severe political attack over his loyalties to American foreign activities, including rendition and other war crimes. This leaves the ghost wondering gravely what he has gotten himself into, and if his predecessor's death was really just an accident, or something more sinister. Polanski gives us no reason to believe otherwise, and as the ghost becomes immersed in Lang's world of secrets, lies, deceit and CIA cover-ups, he realizes that his two-week deadline to finish Lang's memoirs is the very least of his concerns.What is truly stunning about this film, aside from Polanski's sharp and menacing direction, is the amount of information that is retained from the audience. Even as the ghost unpeels the layers Lang's past, and slowly begins to understand what is going on, we are never quite certain about everything. In many cases in a film like this, the pieces are all there and it is our job and the protagonist's job to connect them. In The Ghost Writer, I think that Polanski and co-writer Robert Harris have deliberately chosen to withhold some pieces of the puzzle in order to generate the kind of doubt and anticipation that we experience throughout this film.McGregor gives an excellent central performance as the new ghost trying to put together the events taking place, and his scenes with Williams, some of the more seemingly ambiguous scenes in the film, are wonderfully acted. This is also some of the best work that Brosnan has ever done, as the ex-PM who is attempting to both save his reputation and process his memoirs, while carefully trying to keep the truth submerged beneath what the people want to hear. He has only a few major scenes, but manages to communicate a lot in them.Polanski also plays with modern technology, namely the GPS system, which is used in one brilliant scene where the ghost's predecessor communicates vital information to him from beyond the grave. In another scene, the ghost talks to an old man (Eli Wallach) who says that the current shouldn't have washed the former ghost up along the beach where it did, and that a key witness to it is in a coma. There is also an ingenious moment toward the end involving the passing of a note that keenly evokes Hitchcock.  These kinds of moments, which occur frequently through the film--in nearly every scene, in fact--allow the tension to build and build, until I could actually feel my heart racing.The setting of the film also adds to the growing anticipation, and the ominous tone of the film, as the beach house where the ghost spends most of his time is cut off from the mainland. It is a hazy, cold, isolated, drizzly place where bad things are almost certainly bound to happen. The Ghost Writer is one of the most intensely crafted thrillers in recent years, as it blends classic Hitchcock themes with modern political allusions, while Polanski, I think, also manages to slip in some very personal incite into his own controversial situation with the law. It all adds up to a masterwork of the genre that perhaps offers us more questions than answers by the end, but that is all the more reason to watch it again.\",\n",
              "       \"Bambi is unquestionable a masterpiece. It's one of the best pictures in the Disney catalog and one of the best pictures ever made. It's simple coming-of age story is so pure, so fill with heart and so honest that you can't help but stare in awe throughout its all too brief 70 minutes. Bambi is filled with moments of joy, sadness, danger, courage, love that helps the story be so timeless as it is. A story so excellent as this one is accompanied by some of the best work of animation that have ever come from Disney. The backgrounds are simply amazing and the characters are so well drawn that you have a sense of reality that not many animated films had. A fantastic score is also one of the many great additions that make Bambi the great classic movie that it is. This film represented the end of the golden age period when the five movies released by Disney until that time (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo and Bambi) pushed the boundaries and made animation an art form of unquestionable beauty.Following the excellent BD sets of Snow White and Beauty and the Beast, Bambi is the third movie in the Diamond line and the results are spectacular. Disney is a master in restoring its classic films and Bambi is no exception. The picture is so pure, so clean, so detailed that you will see much more that you ever had before. No artifacts, edge enhacedement and other issues are encountered in the picture. An oustading restoration for an outsatnding film. Likewise, in the audio department, Bambi has been given a new 7.1 Dts-HD HR audio. While this High Resolution audio is not losseless (as the Master Audio), is very effective and I don't think  Bambi could hear any better. Dialogue is crisp and clear and the score sounds magnificently. Also the restored mono soundtrack is included.When I first pre-order this set, I watched in dismay that this Diamond will only have 1 BD instead of two like the other Diamond titles. Well, let me tell you that I don't think there's a need for another one. The first thing that you will encounter in the bonus features department is the new Disney Second Screen. This features syncs the movie with an app in your laptop or ipad and you can watch the movie while additional information appears in the computer. I have to say that this feature is quite entertaining and makes you dive better into the film. The only problem is that the movie goes real fast so you may miss some features but the good news are that you can watch this things on your own without the film (although is not quite as entertaining). Then you have the Inside Walt's Story Meetings-Enhanced Edition. While this feature appeared in the Platinum DVD, this Enhanced mode is way better. As with the Hyperion Studios and Beyond Beauty material in the previous Diamond title, this is a new interactive way to learn more about the making of Bambi. Several actors reenact the parts of Walt and the others involved in the film and you are literally transported in time and is like being in those meetings with them. Simply amazing. Then you also have two new deleted scenes, one newly found song Twitterpated (which I think was good it stayed out of the movie) and an interactive art gallery.Carried from the Platinum DVD is the fantastic making-of documentary The making of bambi: A Prince is Born, a excerpt of a Walt Disney TV show where he explains the use of the multi-plane camera, the animated short The old Mill, two deleted scenes and the theatrical trailer. The only things that I miss from the Platimun are the time capsule featurette and promotional art gallery.A DVD is also included with the film in SD. It looks better than the Platinum but nothing compared to the BD.Bambi is a film that should be in every film collection and this Diamond Edition is a perfect way to own it. With an amazing restoration that brings new life to the film and fantastic and inmersive bonus material this is a must-own release for a must-own movie. Bambi is a timeless classic that I wholeheartely recommend to everyone. Hurry and just buy it!!PD: You should know that this Diamond Edition of Bambi like the Diamond editions of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Beauty and the Beast, comes in two packagings: one in BD packaging and the other in standard DVD packaging. However, both contain the same things: one BD and one DVD. If you want the 2-disc DVD only edition you'll have to wait until April 19.\",\n",
              "       \"Ten years behind bars, and he's so antsy. You see the Rock's character - anonymously labeled Driver - as he restlessly paces in his prison cell, waiting out his last morning in stir, and you know something festers on his mind. Any musings as to whether he's truly been rehabilitated is put to rest when he erupts out the penitentiary and straight away visits an office and guns down a telemarketer. That's cold-blooded. That's one name off his list (yes, there is a list).It's good to see the Rock straying from those sappy family friendly Disney flicks. Good to see him return to his roots and bolstering his action hero street creds. FASTER works off the conventions of a B-movie revenge thriller, and good performances from Dwayne Johnson and Billy Bob Thornton elevate this thing. There are moments of pure cool cinema, like that point of view perspective from the other side of the car's speedometer which allows us a peek out at the seething face of the Rock. I don't think I've seen a revenge thriller this lean and raw and entertaining since Mel Gibson's PAYBACK more than a decade ago.FASTER  is told mainly from three perspectives: the Driver, the Killer, and the drug junkie Cop, with the latter two trying to catch up to the Driver as he continues to eliminate those what done him wrong, those what murdered his brother. Just about every character here is one-dimensional, but Johnson manages to lend nuance to his laconic role. Billy Bob Thornton, as he usually does, adds a little somethin' somethin' to his scruffy, 10-days-to-retirement police detective.One peculiar choice is the film's decision to devote so much camera time and back story to Oliver Jackson-Cohen's elegant contract hit man. He sees in Driver that one challenge he's been looking for, the one guy who may be faster than he is and that gets his competitive juices flowing. But, frankly, ultimately, I didn't think this hit man was all that interesting. He's what passes for shallow glitter. I did get a laugh though that Jackson-Cohen's biggest peeve there at the end seems to be that he's just not getting the professional courtesy he feels he deserves from the Rock. Jackson-Cohen certainly adds an element of quirk, and it doesn't hurt that his personal arc presents the stunning Maggie Grace as eye candy. Grace, Carla Gugino, and Moon Bloodgood somewhat take the edge off the testosterone level, never mind that Gugino herself plays a tough cop detective.Dwayne Johnson strides across the screen as a simmering, single-minded force of nature. He relentlessly drives the film, ratcheting up the pace of the story, and maybe it's a good thing after all that Jackson-Cohen's posh assassin gets his moments because this allows the viewing audience to breathe a bit. I did feel that the film backed away a bit from completely portraying Driver as the hard-bitten ex-convict out for vengeance come hell or high water. That one drawn out sequence with Driver and the pastor sort of killed the buzz. Dang that Bible-thumping. Still, FASTER satisfies your jonesing for taut, hard-core anti-hero revenge flicks. And, look at that, the Rock's suddenly got his swagger back. At least until he stars in TOOTH FAIRY 2 or something.The DVD's extras ain't much: an Alternate Ending (which was the original ending) and 5 Deleted Scenes with optional Director's introductions (except for the Killer Takes A Picture scene).\",\n",
              "       \"Lust Caution is a big, fat melodrama with two small, lifeless gimmicks where its heart and mind should be. It's the story of a young, beautiful Chinese spy who, implausibly, must seduce a Japanese collaborator in order to set him up for assassination. The question that is meant to keep you watching through endless, empty, boring, setup: Will the would-be assassin fall in love with her quarry, a man she is forced to bed?Lust Caution has the production values of a superior melodrama: stitch-perfect vintage costumery: Chinese qi pao, Japanese geisha, and Western power suits and boxy shoulders; big, fat, vintage automobiles, shiny with chrome; and recreated cities of Japanese-occupied 1940s China. This film will satisfy viewers whose only demand of a movie be that it be luscious to look at.The problem is the ersatz gift underneath all those ribbons and inside all that crepe wrapping paper. The movie has no heart, and it has no head. The first hour and a half are unbearably boring and empty. I watched the mahjong scenes a couple of times to make sure I wasn't missing anything. They establish the superficiality of the Chinese collaborators' wives. That could have been accomplished much more quickly. The point of the scenes: look at this Chinese woman's perfect manicure, look at this big, fat ring, look at this silk qi pao. There's nothing there to engage anything other than the eyes.The film's two gimmicks: will the would-be assassin fall in love with her quarry, an utterly despicable man who, the film makes clear, tortures and murders Chinese freedom fighters during his long days at work, at the office. The second gimmick: graphic sex scenes. In online reviews, some of the film's viewers assume that the act is not simulated, but genuine.Japan, of course, committed wartime atrocities every bit as horrific as those committed by the Nazis. They just committed their crimes farther away from Western news cameras. I won't detail here the nightmares the Japanese created in cities like Nanking; Iris Chang, among others, uncovered these hidden atrocities.Lust Caution has chosen a monster for its lead. In bed, though, this torturer is one of the world's great lovers. His masterful feats of lovemaking are so acrobatic you'll not be sure if you're viewing a page from the Kama Sutra or a metaphor invoking ramen noodles.I'd really like to sit director Ang Lee down and ask him a question. Why did you cast actor Tony Leung, handsome, tender, and charismatic, as a torturer? Do you really think real life torturers looked anything like Tony Leung? Leung cannot hide the facial expressions of a human, decent, lovable guy. He is not the best choice to depict a man hardened by years of the kind of tortures that the Japanese performed. Yes, being a professional torturer shows on the face. Look at the faces of professional torturers. They don't look like tender lovers. They don't look like Tony Leung.All of this nonsense could have at least been entertaining, but it's not. Lust Caution has a single-digit IQ, no soul, and a glacial pace. In addition to be grotesque, it commits the cardinal sin of a popular entertainment. It is almost too boring to sit through.\",\n",
              "       \"Even though it's too late to post this for Saint Patrick's Day, The Quiet Man is a joyous, exuberant film to view any day of the year, and you don't have to be Irish to enjoy it, although if you're first generation Irish American as I am, and/or have visited Ireland at least once, you will have a deeper appreciation of it!  For sentimental reasons I do make it a point to view this film every St. Patrick's Day to honor the memory of my late father, who was Irish born, this was his favorite film, many a time he watched it, first whenever it was on regular television, and then on video when the VCR came into existence, he just loved it!Retired American boxer, Sean Thornton (John Wayne), has returned to live in the small town of Innisfree, Ireland, where he was born.  Although he made a good living as a boxer, he accidently killed another man in the ring, and vowed never to fight again.  He purchases back the family homestead from the wealthy Widow Tillane (Mildred Natwick) incurring the enmity of the strapping well to do landowner Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen) who wanted the property for himself.  Spitefully, Will refuses to let Sean court his beautiful, spirited sister Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara) despite the fact they are both in love, and Mary Kate won't wed without her brother's approval.  Will is tricked to into giving his consent by a conspiracy between the matchmaker Michaeleen Flynn, (Barry Fitzgerald), the parish priest Father Lonergan (Ward Bond) and the Protestant vicar Reverend Playfair (Arthur Shields) and his wife Elizabeth (Eileen Crowe), without Sean or Mary Kate's knowledge, and the courtship and the marriage duly take place.  However at the wedding reception Will learns the truth and blames the innocent Sean for the deception.  Enraged he refuses to give Mary Kate her dowry of 350 Irish pounds, which Mary Kate feels is rightfully hers, and she tells Sean to demand it from Will.  Sean doesn't understand the whole custom of the dowry, and it's significance to Mary Kate, and refuses to do so out of pride.  This causes a serious rift between Mary Kate and he that can only be resolved when he confronts and fights Will for the money even though Sean had pledged never to fight again.The above synopsis sounds fairly somber, and while the subject matter is serious director John Ford and screenwriter Frank Nugent make sure that there is plenty of humor and laughter to leaven it out.John Wayne was one of the cinema's most underrated actors; he was much more accomplished than he was given credit in his lifetime.  Amidst all his strong portrayals in Stagecoach, Red River and The Searchers, Sean Thornton stands out as his finest achievement.  Sean is a man of many parts and Wayne captures them all.  Although Sean is robust, virile, and athletic, Wayne is not afraid to show Sean's sensitive, tender side as well, reveal the touch of the poet that sometimes colors his speech.  This is a man comfortable in his own masculinity, who can appreciate beauty, he plants roses outside his cottage, is not afraid to let his wife drive the horse and cart that he has given her.  There is a streak of inherent melancholy in Sean that Wayne suggests; he has to live with the fact that even though it was unintentional, he is responsible for another man's death.  John Wayne truly does plumb the depths of this conflicted man, and stretch himself as an actor.  He absolutely deserved the Oscar for this performance rather than True Grit.  Astonishingly, he wasn't even nominated, yet another Oscar injustice.The entrance of Maureen O'Hara as Mary Kate is one of the most enchanting, beguiling introductions in movie history.  A barking sheepdog is herding a flock of sheep in a verdant, tree lined field, suddenly there is a magical glissando on harp strings, and Mary Kate appears, barefoot, clad in vivid blue and red, her burnished, titian tresses tumbling down her back, holding a staff in her hand as she follows behind, the sun hits her, giving the illusion as if she's lit from within.  She is the embodiment of an ancient Celtic queen from Irish mythology, Maeve or Isolde perhaps?  Sean, at first glimpse is dazzled; he asks Michaeleen rhetorically, Is that real?  She couldn't be!  This was my father's favorite scene, he had owned sheep and tended them in Ireland, and he loved the combination of Maureen O'Hara, whom he adored and the flock.  Ms. O'Hara's Mary Kay is fiery and forthright; tart tongued when needed, (the title is one of her memorable stingers!) with a strong, decided character.  In fact she is a liberated woman, she treats men as equals and will settle for nothing less in return, she meets Sean's passion with her own.  In Ms. O'Hara's hands Mary Kate is gorgeous and glorious, an individual both men and woman can like and admire.  Like Wayne, this is her best performance, and irritatingly like Wayne was not Oscar nominated, what were they thinking that year?I'd like to pay a quick tribute to the charismatic pairing of Wayne and O'Hara, they both bring out the excellence in the other, perfectly designed by nature, with a erotic magnetism, the sparks fly when they're together.  They rightfully belong in the pantheon of classic screen couples such as Tracy and Hepburn, Powell and Loy and Bogart and Bacall.As for the rest of the cast, they are unqualifiedly marvelous one and all!  Leading the list Victor McLaglen as the bull headed Will Danaher, the only cast member to be Oscar nominated, and Barry Fitzgerald as Michaeleen Flynn, who as usual comes perilously close to stealing every scene that he's in.  A round of applause as well to Ward Bond, Mildred Natwick, Arthur Shields, Eileen Crowe and Francis Ford.  Lastly, I want to give a special mention to Jack MacGowran as Feeney, Will's elfin assistant and yes man, who delivers perfectly two of the funniest lines in the film!This film was director John Ford pet project, it took him seven years to bring it to fruition, but it was worth the wait.  It's his own love letter to his Irish ancestry; he pulls out all the stops, uses some Irish clich&eacute;s, but makes it work freshly and beautifully.  It is an idealized version where there seem to be no class distinction and Catholic and Protestant peacefully co-exist, which actually they did except in the strife ridden North of Ireland.  This was also a family film, Ford used his brother, son and brother in law, John Wayne's four children, Maureen O'Hara's two brothers, Barry Fitzgerald's brother, and Victor McLaglen's son. The final creation under Ford's scrupulous supervision is a cinema masterpiece, it was justly rewarded with five Oscar nominations including Best Film, winning for Best Director and Best Cinematography, but as I said earlier, it should have been nominated for at least two more and should have swept the Oscars that year!Besides his dream cast, Ford had a wonderful script by Frank S. Nugent, one that featured such hilarious moments as Mary Kate and Michaeleen's discussing Sean's offer for her hand in marriage, Michaeleen's flabbergasted reaction to the Thornton's broken bed the morning after the wedding, and Father Logergan's struggle to land a prize salmon among others.  Yet there are sweet and tender moments such as when Sean surprises Mary Kate with the gift of a horse and buggy, and when the bewildered couple tentatively reaches out to each other in front of the fireplace after an argument about her dowry.  The script crackles with witty one-liners, but is also balanced by dialogue that has gentleness and even some traces of poetry.The cinematography by Winton C. Hoch is spectacular, Ford sensibly put his foot down and insisted Technicolor be used.  The Irish scenery is breathtaking; I swear you can see almost all of the mythical Forty Shades of Green in the landscape!  If you've never had the pleasure of visiting Ireland before, the cinematography in this film will make you want to go.The musical score is lilting, evocative and romantic, the composer Victor Young has woven traditional Irish songs and airs such as The Isle of Innisfree, The Wild Colonial Boy, Kerry Dances, I'll Take You Home Again, Kathleen,Galway Bay and The Rakes of Mallow into an ingratiating score that adds immeasurably to the film's charm.A very quick note about the special features, the highlights are two excellent documentaries The Making of The Quiet Man hosted by Leonard Matlin, which presents a well researched history of the film, and The Joy of Ireland which mainly features the engaging remembrances of Maureen O'Hara, Ms. O'Hara also does a commentary over the film which is very interesting to hear.Well, one of the notorious characteristics of the Irish is the gift of gab, and I guess judging by the length of this review, I'm proving the point.  If I haven't persuaded you that this is highly recommended by now, I never will.  So, I'll close with a few words of Gaelic - Slan agus beannacht leat (Goodbye and blessings with you)!\",\n",

But on the other hand, you might find this film a very enjoyable experience. It's a good-hearted comedy/drama with impressive performances from Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Diego Luna, Stanley Tucci, etc. Tom Hanks is especially good here. He captures the oblivious-turned innocent attitude almost perfectly, and he gets into character very well. Tucci is a standard cardboard cutout bad guy for most of the film, but he's not too distracting. The comedy is mostly light-hearted (no vulgar jokes or toilet humor), which I guess is appropriate for this sort of film. In the end, it's obvious that this isn't one of Spielberg's best films. But despite the fact that I'm not really a fan of his work, this is still a very good film. It has flaws, but it's very well-made in my opinion.Grade: 8.3/10\",\n",

Of course, it's easy to see once you've seen it. The film has a slick look with a very narrow color scheme giving it an almost sepia tone or black and white look at times. This is a good thing because it makes you focus on the story and not a lot of parlor tricks.I can not recommend this film enough for action fans who want a little more than explosions and senseless violence. The only reason I'm giving this 4 1/2 stars instead of 5 is that I thought the story wasn't all that original despite having some nice twists.\",\n",

It is a complete merging into a character, unlike few performances that one can find these days when celebrities take over characters for their own.  As with all silent film, the gestures are overblown and exaggerated, but in this one it works better because the characters are so strong.In terms of plot, you have a deformed man.  Rather than the blurb that says he has a heart of gold, I think he is full of rage at his maltreatment, and possibly mentally handicapped.  It is only when the gypsy Esmeralda shows him honest, human sympathy that he begins to grow out of the hatred bred in isolation.  BUt he is being used, as a slave, by the manipulative brother (who desires Esmeralda) of the good bishop of Notre Dame.  Then enters the handsome playboy, who falls for Esmeralda after pursuing her purely for pleasure.  After the evil brother attempts to assassinate his rival, only to have Esmeralda blamed and condemned to death.  Quasimodo rescues her, unleashing a frenzy of violent rage from the balcony of Notre Dame.The amazing thing is how moving the film is, how much sympathy Lon C can evoke even as he appears monstrous and even crazy.

              "       \"A movie as bonkers as Roland Emmerich's 10,000 B.C. really ought to be a lot more fun than this actually is. Partially inspired by some of Graham Hancock's less daffy theories of a lost higher civilisation in the Stone Age who really built the pyramids, this sees Steven Strait's hunter-gatherer setting off after the slavers who took the love of his life and the village's other hunters to build the pyramids (with a little bit of help from mammoths, of course). The title promises enjoyable nonsense along the lines of the Harryhausen One Million Years B.C., and with a sabre-tooth tiger and some Terror Birds thrown into the mix the elements are certainly there for good old fashioned brain-off entertainment, but at times it feels almost as long a slog as the one that takes its hero from the barren mountains of New Zealand across Namibia to the plains of Giza. Certainly the first half is pretty dull, with even the scene with Terror Birds (think big turkeys with big teeth, which is at least appropriate for Christmas) picking off slaves and slavers alike in long grass playing like a considerably less effective version of the velociraptor attack from Spielberg's The Lost World with a bit of Mysterious Island thrown in for bad measure.Things do finally pick up a bit when they finally reach `the mountains of the Gods,' but not really enough. It may be the most spectacular part of the picture but at times it feels like an early rejected draft of Stargate - oh look, another evil godlike villain who may be an alien or from Atlantis, and what's this, revolting slaves led by a white man from a far-off land? Clich&eacute;s like this really need more panache than they're given here to come off, and the casting doesn't exactly help you overlook the film's shortcomings. Steven Strait isn't exactly blessed with much charisma as the reluctant hero, coming over a bit like Colin Farrell's well meaning younger brother, Camilla Belle is awful pretty but it's hard to tell if she can actually act when she doesn't have much to do except look confused, the ever-erratic Cliff Curtis is pretty awful here and Omar Sharif manages the almost impressive feat of both underplaying and overacting his narration that seems intended to paper over the gaps and add a bit of emotion to the proceedings (the deletion of his cameo in the original ending spared audiences the worst of his performance, though it can be found on the DVD and all-region BluRay along with 10 deleted scenes and a couple of brief featurettes). Matters aren't helped by co-writer/co-producer/co-composer (with Thomas Wander, ne Wanker) Harold Kloser's score which constantly turns into Hans Zimmer's main theme from King Arthur with such monotonous regularity that you start expecting Maire Brennan to start singing. Even with low expectations this is disappointing stuff.\",\n",

Most people will be able to relate to this film... after all, haven't we all had that really crappy summer job where the only saving graces were the memorable people and after-work experiences that crossed our path because of the connections we made at the job?While the film goes down easy, I appreciated its emotional complexity.  In particular, there's a special effort in the film to keep the characters from being too predictable and one-note: Everyone seems to have good and less-than-good qualities, and act in both stable and not-so-stable ways.  For the most part, the characters use their particular strengths to help out other characters who don't have those same strengths.Adventureland is recommended to those who enjoy understated, indie-style dramas that aren't heavy on simple answers and broad set-pieces.  It's a nice little tale with a handful of funny moments that should satisfy most people looking for a thoughtful, entertaining evening of home viewing.  There's even a little romance.The movie looked and sounded fine on the standard DVD I watched, which also featured a small handful of interesting extras.\",\n",
              "       \"Top Gun director Tony Scott's adrenaline-laced, testosterone-fueled, high-octane actioneer The Last Boy Scout qualifies as an ultra-violent, hideously misogynistic, hard-boiled criminal melodrama about an unlikely pair of pals who thwart a gang of sinister, trigger-happy thugs who advocate sports gambling legalized. These slimy villains are prepared to pay millions to achieve their goal, and they have no qualms about killing anybody who interferes with their plans. The heroes are a hard-boiled private eye who once served as a Secret Service agent and took a bullet for President Jimmy Carter and a former professional football quarterback with a million dollar throwing arm banned from the game for gambling. Typically, the director is considered the auteur, and Scott delivers his signature touches: rapid-fire editing, gauzy-looking shafts of illumination back-lighting doors, windows, staircases,etc., and the alternation of telephoto shots with looming close-ups. Indeed, The Last Boy Scout emerges as a glossy, slickly-produced epic, and Scott stages everything with style and aplomb to spare. The downtown shoot-out at a strip joint rivals anything in an early Steven Seagal movie. Scott thrusts you into the thick of the action without going overboard. Mind you, the explosions are massive fireballs of black smoke and orange flames. In this respect, Tony surpasses his famous older brother Ridley at delivering orgasmic action scenes. Ridley, however, has achieved greater critical and commercial success. Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans constitute the unlikely, interracial heroic duo, and their friendship gets off on a contentious foot before they set aside their feelings and deal with the obnoxious villains who are capable of the worse violence.Nevertheless, the real auteur of The Last Boy Scout is Lethal Weapon scribe Shane Black. Black is attracted to direct opposites. Consider the Lethal Weapon franchise as well as Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang. Remember the suicidal Mel Gibson detective who is teamed up with the pragmatic Danny Glover. These two were are different as night and day, with Glover as the night and Gibson as the day. In Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang, an actor and a gay private eye team up to take on the villains. Happily, the tough but sympathetic heroes in The Last Boy Scout never get a break, and they have a disarming way of handling their setbacks. Black's crude but witty dialogue exchanges between the hard-nosed Willis and the articulate Wayans undercuts a lot of the hard-as-nails gritty action. Quite possibly, anybody who has trouble hearing the repetitious use of the F-word will find this dialogue offensive. Meanwhile, Willis and Wayans generate charisma galore as they play off each other. Black's twists and turns in the narrative, his clever use of foreshadowing, and the wicked villains make this vigorous, 105-minute, mystery yarn entertaining to watch. Indeed, everything is by-the-book, but Black skillfully presents these conventional elements in such compelling fashion that you can overlook their formulaic origins. One of the funniest scenes in The Last Boy Scout occurs early on when our beleaguered hero comes home to find his wife cheating on him. He knows that something is wrong when he catches a glimpse of the commode in the bathroom with the seat raised. Anybody who has lived with a woman for any length of time knows that they hate it when a man leaves the toilet seat up because they may sit down and fall into the commode.This stylist, slam-bang shoot'em up ranks as one of Scott's better efforts. He turns everything into a larger-than-life situation. Nobody can dispute that Top Gun and True Romance show Scott at the top of his game. The Last Boy Scout is gripping from start to finish.\",\n",
              "       \"In 'The Town,' Ben Affleck proves that 'Gone Baby Gone' wasn't a fluke.  He's a top-notch director.  A couple of years back, he suffered from comparisons to erstwhile equal Matt Damon.  Damon seemed to pick all the right projects (The Bourne Trilogy (The Bourne Identity | The Bourne Supremacy | The Bourne Ultimatum)foremost), while Affleck picked dreadful ones (typified by 'Gigli').  Quietly, he started picking better roles and - more importantly - controlling his own destiny.  His presence is in every corner of The Town: screenplay adapter, director, co-star and pseudo-casting agent (he's responsible for many of the Boston authentics that dot both his films).It's an excellent film, expertly told.  As a director, Affleck has staged some small, thrilling scenes.  Most notable: a light, casual lunch between Affleck's character and Rebecca Hall's character which suddenly turns taut and mesmerizing when Affleck's buddy (and co-conspirator) Jeremy Renner unexpectedly shows up.InVicky Cristina Barcelona, everyone talked Cruz, Johansson, Bardem, but it was Rebecca Hall whose performance made that film.  She was incredible.  That happens again here.  You have to believe both her fear (and its after-effects) after the initial robbery and her willingness to be smitten soon after by Affleck's character.  She's the single best thing in the movie.As an actor, Affleck excels, too.  He plays a criminal with a soft heart, albeit well-hidden.  Hall's character sees this side of him, meaning she's got quite a shock coming when the movie's two plotlines intersect.  Affleck has the inherent sensitivity to pull off this dichotomy.  Think if the roles were reversed: could Jeremy Renner do that?  Not with half as much conviction as Ben Affleck.\",\n",
              "       \"It resonates with all the visual excesses and subliminal undercurrents that Argento would later explore to their maximum capacity. It is a tour de force of camera, composition, and film craft skills. It is such a benchmark of smart, passionate film construction that it surpasses expectations and thwarts potential imitations. It's interesting to note that even when Argento presently returns to the giallo style thriller to keep his name in the genre, the films (Tenebrae, Non Ho Sonno, Opera) all resemble pale imitations of Deep Red. In his rethinking of the psycho killer genre, he focuses less on the killer and more on the climate of fear. He wants the threat to come from the unknown, not some clear-cut origin. Because Argento is one of only a handful of horror directors who appreciates and uses the apprehension of the unfamiliar to provide mood for his movies and motivation for audience dread, his films are viewed as disturbing and uncomfortable. But this does not mean they are unsuccessful. Indeed, Deep Red is a terrific thriller.Argento makes several conceptual deviations that cause Deep Red to stand out. First was the idea of creating isolated vignettes, moments in screen time that would not be explained and simply left for the audience to mull over and formulate their own narrative associations. Argento employs this device from the very beginning of the film. As the credits roll and the wonderful score by Goblin begins to throb like the thrillers engine in idle, we wait for the story to motor out of the starting gate. But then Argento turns down the rock and introduces a nursery rhyme style music box melody, and our first vignette plays out. It is Christmas, and in the shadows near the tree, we see a struggle and a stabbing. A scream echoes across the soundtrack and then a huge knife plunges to the floor. As it rests there, the music continues its cheerful childishness and then, a pair of highly glossed juvenile shoes appear, standing over the knife in a shot so exquisite it's like witnessing the birth of a masterwork by a celebrated painter. Before it all registers, we are back to black and the rock throb of the score. The rest of the credits play, and the movie proper begins.Along with breaking convention (the second major deviation to discuss), this immediate interruption of the flow of the film shows that Argento is ready to throw out the standard cinematic guidebook on narrative drive and cohesion and begin his journey into the unexplained. A series of questions arise from the opening moments, questions that will not have answers given to them for a long time, if at all. What did we see? Who had the knife? Is someone hurt? Dead? Why is there a child there? Did the child see it? Did the child do it? Argento uses these questions to begin the process of cinematic prestidigitation of creating a story where everything and nothing is important, all things and only a few things have meaning, and each new scene or character will provide more issues than their presence or dialogue will answer. By building layers of inquiry, Argento is creating substrata in his storyline and the characterization. He is also sewing the seed of suspense. Bit by bit he intends to address everything that he will show onscreen, but he is not about to make the connections or explanations easy. The audience has come along for the ride, and they have to do some work in order to get the most out of Deep Red.\",\n",

              "       \"I think in the end the question posed by the original 1987 source material, The Rules of Attraction, is all about why its characters miss the point that sex, when devoid of all elements of romance, becomes such an empty thing. While this fast-moving film didn't take that question on, it did give us an expos&eacute; on how one collection of young people at an exclusive east coast college are willing to trade almost anything to gratify their desires, even if the means they are using to fill the emotional void are really the last things they need. Although they probably don't know it, they are so collectively terrified of ennui that they take any path but the obvious one to find the happiness that's lacking in their lives. It's effectively tragic and also problematic, because in depicting such empty banality, the story itself runs the risk of seeming to be ABOUT this druggy void, when it's simply not at all.Overall, Roger Avary's movie is a capable adaptation of the 1980s novel. With its split screens and buzzy `80s pop music, it kept up a nearly impossible pace that acted as a stand-in for the paragraph-length chapters Brett Easton Ellis often employed when he penned The Rules of Attraction a generation ago. As written the novel The Rules of Attraction presented some real challenges to anyone wanting to faithfully adapt it to the screen. Much of the story took place inside the thoughts of its characters, important moments existed that would have been all but impossible to successfully translate to celluloid, and great segments of the book came and went without doing much toward moving the plot forward. Also with its vast cast of characters, it could have been a film maker's nightmare to jump into any sort of faithful recreation of what Ellis had in mind. (It is, after all, a novel that opens with the callous defloration of a virgin at a raucous party---...I always knew it'd be like this....---and ends with the reunion of two lovers...only one of the lovers scarcely even remembers the other despite the young woman's obsessive infatuation with him.)I think these considerations explain why no one tried to tackle this book for so long. In my opinion the result of this 2003 attempt to set the novel to screen isn't bad at all. It retains the energy of the book while infusing it with a pace that keeps what works well on the written page working well onscreen. It's momentarily amusing to see James Van Der Beek and Jessica Biel shed their lily-white TV character purity and take on roles as promiscuous drug addicts, but after a few scenes you forget the TV personas and instead notice that both these performers are actually adept actors who bring a convincing performance to the big screen.In among its sex and drugs, its suicide, its homosexuality, and its post-adolescent dramas tragically real and painfully imagined, The Rules of Attraction has a strong back story to tell, and while it's easy to miss it amid the lure of its surface blur, that back story is worth looking for.\",\n",

And it steals its stilted dialogue and declarative voice from the lesser chapters of Tolkien's The Silmarillion.And yet, the darn thing grows on you.Perhaps it's the game cast.  Andy Whitfield, who could ably serve as Brad Pitt's body double, takes on the title role with a certain wooden-headed gusto.  John Hannah throws himself into his role as Batiatus, owner of Spartacus's gladiator school, with all the oily charm he can muster - and that's saying a lot.  Watching Hannah, among the most charming and endearing of actors, sink into depravity like a snake is a rare treat.  Lucy Lawless - yes, the warrior princess - embodies the plotting Roman spouse as Batiatus's clever wife Lucretia.  These two attempt to out-Nero Nero as they drink and love while plotting and murdering their way up the social scale.The other gladiators are a chiseled bunch of lunkheads, given to much snarling and flexing whilst covered in gleaming oil.  The physiques and the acting are both worthy of an NFL locker room.  But these gladiators are so obviously gladiators that we stop expecting this to be another PBS production of I, Claudius and instead lower our expectations to see what these MMA refugees can do.Ultimatley, once you accept Spartacus:  Blood and Sand for what it is - an R-rated comic book aiming for low pulp rather than high art - it becomes entertaining.

              "       \"Released in the summer of 1982, the 30th anniversary of the U.S.S. Enterprise's greatest big-screen voyage is fast approaching.  With the famed 1966-69 television series' original ensemble (William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, James Doohan, & Walter Koenig) gathered together once more, director & un-credited screenwriter Nicholas Meyer nimbly took up the challenge of reinvigorating an aging cast with a stellar intergalactic adventure featuring the return of Captain Kirk's greatest television nemesis: the imperious genetic superman known as Khan.  As a sequel to the first season episode (1966-67), Space Seed, this movie boldly answers the question of whatever happened to Khan (the late Ricardo Montalban) fifteen years after he and his band of marauding castaways were exiled to a remote planet by Captain Kirk as punishment for their unsuccessful attempt to steal the Enterprise.  And the answer is the Federation's worst nightmare: Khan's superhuman terrorist group seizes its top secret Project: Genesis device, which is capable of destroying and regenerating planets, as the device's possessor sees fit.  The only resistance in Khan's immediate path is the U.S.S. Enterprise, which this time is mostly staffed by cadets led by Admiral Kirk and Captain Spock.What is perhaps most impressive about Meyer's feat (which is enhanced by Montalban's intense performance) is that one doesn't even have to view Space Seed beforehand to easily grasp who Khan is and the dark motivations behind his hellish vengeance sought against Kirk for the death of his beloved wife, a former Enterprise crewmember.  With that said, the balanced script for this second Star Trek movie is nothing short of superb in poignantly portraying Admiral Kirk's ongoing mid-life crisis, as well as the newly promoted Captain Spock and the other veteran crew members serving as instructors on an ominous cadet training voyage.  Further, the plotline effectively integrates several new characters such as Kirstie Alley as Saavik; the late Merritt Butrick as David Marcus (Kirk's previously unacknowledged son); Judson Scott as Joachim; the late Paul Winfield as the ill-fated Captain Clark Terrell; and the late Bibi Besch as Dr. Carol Marcus (who may perhaps be the true reason behind Kirk's failure at long-term romances).  Most notably, Leonard Nimoy's final scenes as Captain Spock are no doubt the best ever filmed for his beloved character, and his last exchange with William Shatner in the Enterprise's engine room is arguably the most poignant moment in the franchise's storied history.With startling ease and on a modest, streamlined budget no less, Meyer concocts a highly intelligent, literate adventure film that deftly weaves timeless adult themes of untested youth, the inevitability of old age, vengeance, death, grief, and even possible rebirth together that, despite a major character's demise in the climax, leaves audiences with a spiritually uplifting experience about gracefully embracing old age with the vibrant enthusiasm of seemingly eternal youth.  Additionally, two famous quotes from the classic novel A Tale of Two Cities bracket the film like bookends reiterating how life and death are not simply the beginning and the end; rather, it is also the philosophical manner in which one chooses to face them along the way.  Once you hear Leonard Nimoy's ghostly echo in the closing captain's log and then the first bars of the closing theme from James Horner's memorable, nautical-flavored score, you will know that you have just witnessed a first-class science fiction film that doesn't insult viewers with tedious clich&eacute;s and unnecessary, gaudy special effects.  This is the reason that Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, remains the bar by which all other Trek films have been measured and rightfully so.Rating: 10/10.  Appropriate for ages 10 and up (for occasional profanity and some mild gore).P.S.  The numerous special features include cast interviews, trailers, documentaries, etc.  They complete an excellent package for consumers.\",\n",

It's a completely moronic premise that serves as nothing more than a thin vehicle to move from one throwaway sight gag to the next, but never has any illusions about evolving into something bigger. The film sticks with its bread and butter, a series of skits that would've been right at home on a particularly brainless episode of SNL, while dedicating as little time as possible to furthering the plot. Fortunately, many of the jokes and puns are still genuinely funny, although the ratio between those that kill and those that go down in flames is pretty weak when compared to some of its contemporaries.

The first cut was 3h, so it's possible scenes that fleshed out the details were dropped. The result is a rather schematic presentation of the tale. It's not the mess Roger Ebert decreed it, but Boorman assumes you have a fair grasp of the story, and don't need detailed explanations of motive and character. If you don't, you can be rather lost on the first viewing. Despite its faults, Excalibur is one of the best King Arthur films.The image quality ain't very good. Nearly every scene looks as if it was shot through a fog filter. For a film that should be visually lush, the contrast is way too low. (Jacking it all the way up on my plasma display helped a great deal.)I initially reported that the sound was terrible. I pulled out the LV this morning and synched up the players. The sound was considerably better (I don't know why), and there was little or no difference between the two formats. I suspect the apparent difference was caused by my listening in the afternoon, when my hearing often declines.It's probably possible to do a better transfer from the camera negative (if it exists), but that isn't going to happen soon, if ever. Regardless, the price is low enough to justify purchase. Not to mention Nicole William's screwy turn as Merlin.\",\n",
              "       \"Beauty needs imperfection to truly be perfected. Cindy Crawford needs her mole to truly be beautiful.  Harrison Ford needs that little scar to make that face truly unique.  And movies need their imperfections too.. it's the accidents that happen that create those perfect moments of cinema, the magical moments that you remember.  And yes, that is exactly what is missing here...  we have the perfect star pedigree of Cruise and Diaz, the exotic locations with perfect weather, the polished concept of a caper movie combining action and romance with comedy, the likes of which Cary Grant and Hitchcock excelled.  So what's the problem?  It's well enough executed, the action scenes are well choreographed and storyboarded... but it has no magical moments.  It's an airbrushed movie, with the car chases not quite getting the pulse racing, because as excellent as the cgi is, and as innovative as some of the ideas are, you never quite believe it when it's too polished.  As well rehearsed as the smiles and faces full of perfect teeth are, you never quite feel the chemistry is real, just well rehearsed.For the record, Diaz is an everyday woman not quite satisfied with her place in the world but not knowing anything more... until she meets Cruise apparently accidentally, who draws her into a world of espionage, plane crashes, shootouts, car chases and general melee, interspersed with toothy grins and cocktail making skills in exotic and romantic locations around the world.  Is he a rogue spy, is he using her, or is he a framed man, the only honest one she should really trust?That's the idea - recreate a caper movie, for a new generation, with a woman as the `everyman'.  The balance between humour and action never quite sticks though.. the tone never finds its way as the punch of action scenes is lost with the addition of hokey attempts at comedy and romance, and the romance lost due to.. well, just a lack of chemistry frankly.  If the film deserves credit, it's for the admirable use of some terrific and varied locations.In the end though, what is Cindy Crawford without her mole?  What do perfect features become without that imperfection to draw attention to the beauty?  What happens when the scars and blemishes, the wrinkles are magicked away..?  You're left with just a Barbie doll, a plastic version of the real thing... and what we have here is a Barbie doll of a movie, lacking character or moments to remember.  Polish has turned to airbrush, and while you might survive the movie without being too bored, it will fade from your memory faster than it took to watch it.Sorry, as pleasant as all the ingredients were, this just didn't work for me. Switch off the brain and relish the locations and undeniable charm of the stars, you'll do ok - but beware, don't let any analytical thought start to furrow your brow.\",\n",

When these actors are riffing, this film is a winner.There are flaws: the movie never makes up its mind if its' a nostalgic lookback at one of America's oldest and craziest professions and at those who continue the tradition - and those who continue because they are convinced they can do no other work and be successful. Another lost opportunity to make this movie Oscar-bound: by not setting up a believable relationship between the Wrestler and The Stripper (MT), both well past their prime (about 12 years too old to be doing what they do for a buck). The relationship would be very real as both are performers, both are equally concerned about image and both do choreographed steps for the public.So we get a typical drama involving a feminist survivor and the proverbial guy who just doesn't get it.It must be noted that Rourke and Tomei obviously researched their roles, and this goes a long, long way. Tomei's sensuality snaking around that pole is close to unbelievable, suggesting that she is engaged to make it look right.Don't want to give away the very predictable ending...but Sly Stallone should have been called in as a consultant for thye climactic contest in the squared circle. In Rocky I we walk up the aisle exhausted but inspired - I joined my first gym later that year - Stallone worked us up viscerally *and* intellectually.IT's laudable that the matches are beautifully realized...and going back to the inevitable Rocky reference, they are far more credible than the roundhouse riots in the '76 film.[Viewers may recall another Asbury Park, New Jersey shoot with Rourke in 1987, the title of which escapes me, but which involves a boxer's sustaining in the club scene and his activities with low characters, bent on taking advantage of his *youthfullness*].\",\n",

Paired with the feisty, super cute Sandra Bullock, and pitted against Dennis Hopper, who is as good as it gets as an uber villain, Keanu is surprisingly palatable (if not totally forgettable) in SPEED, one of the best high octane action films on the planet.Yes, we're all familiar with the plot:  when SWAT cop Jack Traven (Reeves) and his partner, Harry (Jeff Daniels), foil a terrorist/ransom plot at an LA high rise, maniacal villain Howard Payne (Hopper) reacts worse than the proverbial woman scorned.  He rigs a city transport bus with explosives, then activates the bomb once it's in motion; if the bus ever slows below 50 mph, it's curtains for those unfortunates on board.  Of course, good ol' Jack delivers himself for the rescue (via a commandeered convertible, of course) and, aided by Bullock's bewildered character, who takes over when the bus driver is shot, this ADD thriller really starts to move.  Is all of it over the top, with most of Reeves's action sequences in the cartoon realm?  And is the ending so silly and disbelieving the viewer is chuckling at the zaniness?  Absolutely, but who cares?  SPEED is a white knuckler thriller that will have you turning somersaults from your couch.  If you haven't seen SPEED, you're way overdue for a grand roller coaster ride.

              "       \"Ben Stein and the film's creators do a wonderful job of exposing the bias that is causing the ouster of many from the hollowed halls of evolutionist institutions. We see an industry in the grip of the kind of knee-jerk hysteria that characterizes those who have something to lose - thus the hyperbolic vitriol and emotionalism directed toward Intelligent Design adherents by (ironically) rational persons of science. Evolutionists have much to lose. Secretly, they know that Darwinism is a troubled theory that has been patched endlessly, like a bad tire. It is a joy to see Ben Stein visit with these evolutionists, and expose their absurd explanations for the origins of life (seeding of the planet by extra-terrestrials, anyone?) which they proffer as a refutation to the notion of design. But more than a much deserved comeuppance and expos&eacute;, the film shows the potential progression of Darwinian thought - how it can lead, given an evil mind (like Hitler), to eugenics, to genocide. And why shouldn't it? If we're nothing more than grown up germs, then morality is an illusion - a construct of irrational religionists - so, what matter is it if some germs over here kill six million germs over there? If we are the product, not of the God who morally orders the universe, but of dumb chance, and of the primordial ooze, then there is no real morality, is there? Expelled will be a thought-provoking eye-opener for many - don't miss it.\",\n",
              "       \"One of the epic genre's most reliable warhorses, with at least nine screen adaptations from the first one-reel silent version in 1901 to the 2001 Polish minseries-cum-movie, Henry Sienkiewicz's Quo Vadis in many ways set the template for all the epics about the Roman Empire's persecution of Christians that would follow, from The Sign of the Cross to The Robe. As might be expected from the novel's 1895 vintage, it's more myth than history, but its twin narratives of lovers initially separated by religious differences and later by Nero's need for a scapegoat after the burning of Rome and of the court intrigues as the mad emperor plans his greatest artistic masterpiece offers something for everyone with its mixture of spectacle, cruelty, piety and perversity to get across its message that selfless love is better than selfish ambition.MGM's initially troubled 1951 version may have got off to a false start a couple of years earlier when Gregory Peck, Elizabeth Taylor, Walter Huston and John Huston stumbled at the first hurdle when Peck developed an eye infection three days before they were supposed to leave for Rome even though an estimated million dollars had already been spent, but Mervyn Le Roy's recast completed film is still the definitive one. It might have been a couple of years too early for the wide screen, but it's perfectly placed in time between old school morality - no difficult questions asked here - and more sophisticated and lavish filmmaking than had ever been seen before. While the film has its fair share of model shots and matte paintings, the latter even managing to give the illusion of movement thanks to Peter Ellenshaw's ingenuity, its pre-CGI vintage guarantees it a genuine cast of thousands (a young Sophia Loren lost in the crowd of extras in the triumph scene among them) and massive sets with all the artistry Cinecitta's Italian technicians could give it thanks to MGM's almost blank cheque production.The end result isn't a patch on the level of intelligence and maturity that Roman epics like Ben-Hur and Spartacus would bring to the genre less than a decade later, but it's an impressively staged and mostly entertaining big show that, like the novel, provides something for everyone. For the old school there's Robert Taylor's brash and vain conquering general's romance with Deborah Kerr's Christian hostage who constantly befuddles all his arrogant certainties, which dutifully ticks all the clich&eacute;d boxes of the genre as he finally Sees The Light and becomes a better person. Taylor's old-fashioned movie star turn is never as wince-inducing as, say, Frederic March's Marcus Superbus in The Sign of the Cross, but he's still effortlessly outmatched by Kerr's sincerity in a thankless role as the good girl with the hots for him while Finlay Currie's sermonising as Peter - complete with reverential tableaux courtesy of Da Vinci - seems more dreary professional than passionate. Much more interesting is the relationship between the cynical poet and courtier Petronius (Leo Genn) and Peter Ustinov's scene-stealing homicidal spoiled brat Nero, as the born survivor uses his wits not to improve matters for the people but to improve his own chances with a kind of bemused detachment before realising the horrifying consequences of all his flattery. Petronius and the slave who loves him (Marina Berti) even get the film's best love theme in Miklos Rozsa's impressive score. All this and Anthony Mann's fire of Rome scene making a decent stab at making the burning of Atlanta look like a backyard bonfire and all the Christians, lions and crucifixions you could want in the arena giving it that essential mixture of piety and exploitation that lets the audience enjoy the carnage and decadence of the bread and circuses as much as their Roman forebears without losing their sense of moral superiority. Nero would have approved - though he would have wanted to change the ending...It's a handsome looking film and Warner Home Video's restoration mostly does it proud. The film's popularity over the past six decades had taken quite a toll on the original negative, with TV and video prints bleached out and undetailed, but a lot of work has gone into restoring the color and definition to make it look almost as good as it did when it came out. There are a few minor niggles here and there where a patch of green in the wrong place makes its presence felt for a couple of frames (a common problem with early Technicolor) and it's irritating that the DVD is spread over two DVDs with the scene break in the middle of a sequence, but otherwise there's little to complain about (not a problem with the single-disc Bluray, though the picture quality is not a huge upgrade from the DVD). Along with the striking teaser trailer built around a still of the triumph scene that appeared in Life Magazine and the full five-and-a-half minute trailer there's an audio commentary by F.X. Feeney and a 43-minute documentary. Unfortunately there's a real lack of behind the scenes footage, no-one involved in the making of the film participates, and none of the talking heads have researched the film in detail (Richard Schickel in particular feels like he just offered a few soundbites while being interviewed about another film, though Christopher Frayling is typically good value), but it is a decent overview of the genre and its unpopularity with critics and appeal to audiences.\",\n",
              "       \"The Fighter' breathes a bit of fresh air into the subject.  That isn't to say that the film is without its detractors, for it has those, but for the most part this is a fun and exciting ride that contains sharp notes that accentuate what could have been a `far too familiar' ride through `familiar territory'.`The Fighter', which probably should have been called `The Fighters', tells the dual story of Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund; two brothers with similar dreams and differing setbacks.  Dicky was a onetime boxing champ who lives in his glory days by abusing drugs.  Micky, his younger brother, strives for a glimmer of what his brother had, but his volatile relationship with his family (namely his mother) make it increasingly more difficult for him to capitalize on his potential.  Once Micky meets and falls for spitfire bartender Charlene, his life starts to change and his career starts to take off as he begins to take pride in his own future.  But, family is always lurking around the corner, and soon Micky knows he'll need to fuse his two lives together.There really isn't anything `new' about `The Fighter'.  The story seems rehashed from nearly every other `semi-popular' sports film ever made.  It is a formula that is rarely messed with (although it could use a facelift).  But, with generously crafted performances, a smart (and fluid) script and some keen direction, `The Fighter' feels far fresher than it really is.Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg are sensationally good here, especially Bale who just tears into the scenery and his character with reckless abandon.  He inhales every ounce of character to be created and spits it out with every tick and reflex and emotional complexity intact.  With a character like Dicky (drug addled failure) there is no room for subtlety, but there is a need to remain authentic, and Christian Bale delivers flawlessly.  Wahlberg had the difficult assignment of not getting lost in the antics of the actors around him (mainly Bale and Leo) and he manages to do just that.  Amy Adams is also wonderful, changing up her own pace and taking on a character that is unlike any she's tackled in the past.  She is feisty and sexy and all around undeniable.  I loved the paternal warmth that Jack McGee was able to pull out of such a small role as well.  Now, there is much debate about Melissa Leo.  Yes, she was entertaining and engrossing and yet she was shamelessly skin deep and lacked the depth and complexity that the rest of her co-stars brought to the role.  I was not a fan of her Oscar win, despite the fact that her performance was `good'.In the end, `The Fighter' isn't a total knockout, but it has something special, something extra that makes it stand out amongst a crowd of similarly themed films.  You can feel the passion in the film, a passion that is hard to fake.\",\n",

At its core, this is a damning glimpse into the coal-black heart of addiction and withdrawal that doesn't limit itself strictly to drug use. While the most striking scenes are undoubtedly zoned in on Frankie's habit, particularly the brutal cold turkey scenes near the finale, in the supporting cast there's an equally poignant message about the similarities you'll find in the overuse of any intoxicating experience, whether it be heroin, gambling or love itself. An impressively fresh, open-minded picture that's less concerned with painting the drugs themselves in a poor light than it is the weak-willed men and women who overuse them.

Sorry, but besides the fact she radiates all of the emotional range from A to A, NSA (of which I am an alumnus) deals with electronic espionage and code breaking, not the kiss kiss bang bang stuff. The villain looks like he stepped out of a Brooks Brothers catalog, and despite his attempts at sneering malice, looks more like the guy who didn't get the part of Sebastian in Brideshead Revisited. I wouldn't spoil the plot of this movie by relating it here--the writers did that in their screenplay.

If you want a culmination of all the great directors who have mined this genre, like Ford, Mann and Hawks--you couldn't look no further than this classic.  Yet there's also a touch of the sardonic in Leone's direction that we don't get these great directors.  My only complaint is in the dubbing of some of the villains in this film.  In particular at the beginning of this film where Bronson meets the three hombres dispatched by Frank (Fonda), they are brilliantly played by 2 distinctly American character actors, Woody Strode and Jack Elam, plus an unknown european actor I'm unfamiliar with.  I'm very familiar with Elam's voice so it was disconcerning to me to find him dubbed--and it didn't match his physical demeanor.  One will never know why Leone did this since Jack's voice is sinister enough to convey menance.  Anyway, outside of Cardinale's dubbing which I can understand since she definitely has an Italian accent plus a semi-raspy voice, the leads are superb with the added attraction of Fonda's cold-blooded killer, one of the first times along with his role in Firecreek, to play against image--and successfully to boot.  He's stated in interviews that this was one of his favorite roles, playing an outright S.O.B. with no saving graces--and I agree.

David Seidler's script is simple but witty, eloquent without aiming for eloquence.  That's because it's a tribute to one of Seidler's inspirations, as Seidler himself worked to overcome his stutter as a young man.  Seidler puts the focus on the people rather than the history, which is precisely why the film succeeds.  Colin Firth is perfect casting, his firm, regal brow and humble humor just what the part needs, and his chemistry with Geoffrey Rush, whose own charismatic majesty sometimes outshines Firth's own, brings to life the bond of their characters.  The film's great oddity is its director, Tom Hooper, versed almost exclusively in British TV, and it shows in the dreary colors and muted lighting.  Hooper uses the oldest trick in the avant-garde book, constantly framing each character in the right or left corner of the image.  It's to his credit because it works.\",\n",
              "       \"In this film, the overarching story is one of futile sexuality, a sexuality that is used in a counter-intuitively destructive manner.  Consummation is procured not with the intention of creating life, but of harming another person.  And, as much as animalistic allusions are referred to and this seemingly incessant drive to reach a state of primitive ecstasy is echoed time and again, whenever sexual acts are described, they are done so in a dehumanized, emotionless manner, as if to say that they can only exist as an abstraction.  This is reinforced by the fact that the acts are never actually shown, only talked about.Julia Roberts portrays perhaps the most tragic character of all, as she becomes the sad stranger in an ever-changing partner merry-go-round, yet, as Larry put it, she does not want to be happy, and has to compromise in order to avoid being swallowed by uncertainty.  As she kisses Dan at the beginning of the film, her camera goes off, and she immediately stops... she makes sad strangers look beautiful in photographs, and when her picture is taken, she runs the risk of looking beautiful, a threat which proves too big.Equally living in a psychogenic vortex is Dan himself, who pines for his mother every night and tries to sublimate this by engaging in intercourse with unknown women, he cannot risk becoming dependent on someone who may ultimately leave him (as parents almost inexorably do).  He desires Anna because she doesn't need him.  When he's on the computer talking to Larry, he personifies his conflict well.  He cannot have the desired object, thus he must become the object, and control her fate... he pretends to have an orgasm as Anna, yet says it was not good, closing in the fantasy that he is the only man who can provide Anna with a pleasurable sexual experience, he controls her orgasmic thrill, as it was.  The movie's title tantalizingly denotes how at so many different points in the film one character is longing for a holding, comforting other, yet this other is never in the same place.  Scene after scene we observe one person crying and begging for some sign of mirroring affection, but crying is reproached by the detached party, in a sick fourth-dimensional mockery of human relations, yet one that is very accurate in showing that when one succumbs to the desire of the other (showing vulnerability, devotion, commitment), desire is killed.  They are all spheres in themselves who are too afraid to touch because they may fuse, so an intellectualized verbal experience of intimacy is all they can hope for.\",\n",

Gus Van Sant's third death movie is a movie that stretches out a five-minute plot to a full-length movie, filled with talking, walking, sitting, talking, walking, and... MORE WALKING. It's like watching home videos of two strangers backpacking.In a sense, I have already described the plot. Two young men, both named Gerry (Matt Damon and Casey Affleck), drive out into the desert to look at a thing. Then they decide they don't want to see the thing, and so instead of driving back to civilization and going to a bar like SANE people, they... keep walking.And walking. And walking. They walk through a field. They follow animal tracks. They walk through more desert. And when they get lost, their desperation leads them to violence. Here's the abridged summary: ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZSNORESNOREZZZZZZZZZZZZ.In a sense, I can understand what Gus Van Sant was doing -- Gerry has some intriguing ideas about how endless boredom, monotony and disorientation can warp our minds, and it is graced with eerie, almost otherworldly scenery with rolling clouds, pale soft skies and ethereally alien desertscapes. And since this is based on real life, it allows us to explore human nature.But it's JUST. SO. BORING. It actually feels like you're lost in a desert... and that is BORING.It's just ten-minute-long shots of Affleck and Damon shuffling slowly across the sand, driving the car, sitting on rocks, and watching the sun rise. Every time the monotony starts to bore you into a hypnotic stupor, reminding the viewers that they are watching a movie that is as interesting as watching paint dry. On grass. While a glacier melts.And maybe that is what Van Sant was going for. Maybe he wanted us to feel bored, frustrated and empty... but he also gives viewers absolutely nothing else. It's just an endless, mindless trudge across the desert, which doesn't really make you think about anything deeper than PLEASE GOD, KILL THEM BOTH.In conclusion, Gerry is like watching someone's vacation videos... if they decided to do an endurance trek, and forgot to turn off the camera first.

              "       \"Astro Boy may be old, but the true believers just won't let Tezuka's work die with him. Just as Lion King and Jungle Emperor Leo set hardcore animation nuts wondering just who was ripping off who, likewise many will take notice of the tributes, homages, maybe even stolen material in Astro Boy and think it's a second-rate animated flick not worthy of their attention. They couldn't be more wrong. Astro Boy was not only the best animated film of the year, but quite possibly the best FILM released that year (for a variety of reasons).The people who ran Imagi like so many people fighting to achieve greatness, seemed to be totally clueless to the fact that no one would notice their films without a gargantuan amount of marketing when Disney and DreamWorks are around, and went right ahead and make a first-rate triple A animated film.For the voice cast (among others) we have Freddie Highmore (gaining more of my respect with each role since August Rush), Donald Sutherland (a villain for a change), Nathan Lane (to whom I should really write a letter thanking him for all the awesome voice-acting since Titan A.E. and the Lion King movies) as the intriguing Ham-Egg (gotta love that name), Kristen Bell as the teen girl Cora, and a few other surprises (Samuel L Jackson? Oh yeah!) as well as the obvious Nicholas Cage (whose career seems to only have gone downhill from here. All of the voice acting is EXCELLENT.The animation and art is simplistic, but beautiful, and at times, even breath-taking. Metro City is spartan, but the flying scenes have all of the energy and chair-gripping exhilaration they ought to. The world below has the lived-in mechanical wasteland motifs you would expect, while never becoming depressingly so. Bright colors are used through-out, and the overall quality to me seems JUST shy of Disney quality. Everything also has a wonderfully retro design with the elongated faces and occasional hooked noses that Tezuka is famous for. If you are a fan of old-school animation as well as CGI animation you will love the look of this movie.The sound design is home theater demonstration quality, having a realistic aspect missing from a lot of modern animated films. And of course, John Ottman's (Super Returns) score is ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT. Not good. Best soundtrack of the year (this coming from me, the person who has written letter to the Prague Orchestra and has hundreds of orchestral recordings that he listens to daily). In fact, I would go so far as to say that like Tron:Legacy, the music pushes the film to new heights, greatly increasing the drama, exhilaration, and heart-warming of it's best scenes.Personally I hate it a film wastes time explaining EVERYTHING through the course of the film. Other than the opening where you are given a short history of Metro City and the use of robots (and blue core and red core attributes) the movie lets its world and characters explain themselves (there is no explanation of The Three Laws). It all feels very natural, and leaves a lot open to interpretation. Personally I love that, but I'm sure those who have gotten used to Western-style spoon-fed plot may not not like this. For instance, (spoiler alert) after the death of Tobey, Dr. Tenma says that he's strange. Pay close attention. The film never says WHY Astro is unlike Tobey and leaves it up to you to figure out, but if you notice the subtle things that Astro does (still thinking he is Tobey) like telling a robot not to call him master, and the interests of Tobey before (he was fascinated with weapons) it is quite obvious. The blue core energy made Astro COMPLETELY good. He has no selfishness, no anger, no competitiveness, and no malice. Tobey was just a normal kid with the usual mix of good and bad nature. But again, this never spelled-out for you. The film is loaded with these sorts of subtle points for you to think over.Some of the more obvious references in Astro Boy can of course be taken (as they obviously are) as pot-shots at real-world elements that run counter to the ideals of the film (A War-Mongering Politician Whose Re-election Hinges on Starting a War anyone?), but to strip the film of any references to known tropes and real world elements would likely take away some of the very things that make it such a solid piece of entertainment.I will be honest. I'm an animation nut. I've been following animation since I could talk, and my dedication has only grown over the years. I went to see this film in the theater BY MYSELF, and I know I was the only adult who went to see it alone because of my love of old-school anime. I don't profess to be any kind of Tezuka expert, but I love the themes I have found in all the works produced from his source material (I've seen the anime Metropolis, own Jungle Emperor Leo, and love the Gameboy Advance Astro Boy). The people in that audience had all the great sci-fi and retro ideas go right over their heads, but I was thrilled right out of my skin. I saw in the theater as the End Credits rolled, soaking in the AMAZING musical score, saying to myself THIS is why I go to see movies in the theater and am a fan of animation.At the end of Astro Boy (spoiler alert) when Astro prepares to make a heroic sacrifice, I knew that the entire movie was a formulaic tribute to the ideals of Tezuka, a re-imagining went through the motions with a smile and a hug, a fan-letter to people who love all the things it embraces. I knew that there was nothing new about this movie. But I'll tell you what....I was MOVED by this film. My eyes were tearing up. And watching the phenomenal Blu Ray with it's amazing picture and sound on my 42 inch plasma at home, once again the same thing happened. If you consider yourself ANY kind of anime or animation fan you owe it to yourself to see Astro Boy. The only thing that's missing....is a Japanese Dub of the film on the Blu Ray. :)With PDI (Ice Age, Madagascar) and Pixar (Cars, Up) fighting tooth and nail for the hearts, minds, and (especially) wallets of film-going families everywhere under the umbrella of Dreamworks and Disney, it truly warms my heart to know that despite all the hype, marketing, merchandising, and corporate meddling, an animated film that is actually GOOD can still be made. Imagi Animation Studios, established in 2000 and closed down on February 7, 2010 sought (according to Wikipedia) to create high-quality CG-animated feature films with superhero themes to entertain global audiences, which the company achieves by combining Hollywood storytelling with computer animation done in Hong Kong. Anyone who saw the excellent TMNT and the wonderful Astro Boy knows that they accomplished that goal. TMNT and Astro Boy had not only great animation, voice-acting, and story-telling, but all the heart and soul that has been lacking from Western animation in the past few years. Tezuka would be proud.\",\n",

Why is he so beautiful?  N-E way, he is really cool in this movie which only adds to his complete and total hotness.  What I like about this movie is how confident Lucas is. He is a nerd but can he really be described as a nerd? He likes bugs and he is really smart, but he is very confident, not at all a victim, even though his life is a sad and tragic story with a absent mother and alcoholic father that is not seen but only talked about during the film. He lives in a ratty old trailer park and works for a gardner. He is bullied on a regular basis but endlessly fights back against the bullies. In a constant battle to demand his right to exist he finally earns the respect of his peers in a very moving and powerful end.',\n",

              "       \"A Bridge Too Far, the hugely budgeted 1977 war epic, is such a jumble of larger-than-life talents it's a fascinating curiosity. A film that could not possibly be made today, and frankly was difficult to make in the 1970s, it details one of the largest military offensives of World War II. Dubbed Operation Market Garden and the brainchild of Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery, 40,000 British and American soldiers were parachuted behind Netherland enemy lines to capture bridges Germany was using for escape. For multiple reasons, the maneuver was a disaster. Based on Cornelius Ryan's 1974 bestsellerA Bridge Too Far: The Classic History of the Greatest Battle of World War II(with a screenplay by William Goldman), the film is obviously a project of love for producer Joseph E. Levine (A bridge too far: Notes from a film maker).There's no doubt great heroism was displayed during the epic struggle, and one must applaud Levine's attempt at detailing what was a colossal military failure. The many talents mentioned, including a distractingly breath-taking cast of James Caan, Gene Hackman, Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Anthony Hopkins, Robert Redford, Laurence Olivier, Ryan O'Neal, Elliot Gould, Dirk Bogarde, Edward Fox, Liv Ullmann, Hardy Kruger and Maximilian Schell, keeps things interesting throughout the long three-hour running time. But it's a furiously uneven journey, with each A-list actor wasted in roles amounting to little more than cameos. A Bridge Too Far would have been better served to focus on one (or two) specific characters and show this elaborate battle from their viewpoint.I first saw this as a child and left the theater scratching my head.Patton (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)orThe Great Escapeit was not. I have watched it since and appreciate director Richard Attenborough's (Gandhi (Widescreen Two-Disc Collector's Edition),Cry FreedomandShadowlands) attempts at detailing the confusion of war leading to the sacrifice of thousands of lives. This is a well-made film, with brilliant cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth, but it's still extraordinarily difficult to follow. Vignettes come and go and just when you are interested in a specific character, they disappear as we jump to yet another locale. Generals plan, staring at obligatory maps. Lieutenant-Colonels are stranded by traffic jams. Polish generals are trapped by poor weather. Portable radios refuse to work. German resistance is surprisingly strong. Pockets of soldiers are isolated. Some bridges are destroyed, others guarded and one is even rebuilt. A Bridge Too Far is, if anything, a great cure for insomnia.Now for the good. The airborne drop of thousands of soldiers must rank as one of the most extraordinary scenes ever filmed in an era before CGI. Multiple towns are reduced to rubble in amazing sequences so authentic it feels as if you're watching a documentary. Despite the screenplay's determined disarray, a few actors bring the chaos to life. Hopkins is brilliant as British Lieutenant-Colonel John Dutton Frost, a loyal and subtle leader who holds a bridge before being surrounded. Caan makes an appearance in the film's best scene as a dogged soldier who forces a doctor (an uncredited Arthur Hill) by gunpoint to save his captain. Surprisingly, Redford's appearance practically saves the film. He skillfully plays Major Julian Cook, a U.S. grunt forced on a suicide mission to cross the Waal River by daylight in leaky row boats. He succeeds heroically, though loses half his men in the messy process.Otherwise, actors as accomplished as Hackman and Olivier barely have a single scene. Connery spends much of the film trapped in a civilian attic. While I have no doubt these incidents are historically accurate, and an unusually large amount of survivors served as technical advisers, this is ultimately a film only the most rabid military enthusiast could love. I'm the first to admit when reading about historical battles, I often fantasize about great actors portraying the generals and how the story would play as a film. Levine, when reading Ryan's book, did just that - a Bostonian daydreamer with a vision rivaling an obsessive Cecil B. DeMille (Empire of Dreams: The Epic Life of Cecil B. DeMille). Sometimes less is more. You'll get none of that in A Bridge Too Far, of interest for that reason alone.\",\n",
              "       \"Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan can either be viewed as one of the most harrowing declines of an artist in recent memory or an exercise in high camp. Either way you view it this is one of those films that needs to be seen.Nina ( Natalie Portman) is a ballerina in a New York City ballet company whose life, like all those in her profession, is completely consumed with dance. She lives with her obsessive former ballerina mother Erica ( Barbara Hershey) who exerts a suffocating control over her. When artistic director Thomas Leroy ( Vincent Cassel) decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder) for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily (Mila Kunis), who impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side - a recklessness that threatens to destroy her.This film was a breakthrough for Portman, who picked up the Oscar for best actress for her portrayal. She appears in every scene of the film and the performance is always engaging. Equally important is cinematographer Matthew Libatique's creepy hand held camera work which makes the entire film feel claustrophobic and more akin to a horror film than a a normal drama. This is a compelling film that may take several viewings to truly appreciate. The film is perhaps one of the darker offerings of the year also so don't go in expecting a pleasant ride.The Blu Ray disc offers a great transfer. The original grainy feel produced from shooting with multiple types of camaras and film stocks is present making the film feel like an indie. The sound while not booming conveys the film's feeling quite well. Extra features inclue a fifty minute making of feature and  quite a few short promo type pieces.Recommended\",\n",
              "       \"The Coen Brother's reworking of Charles Portis's novel TRUE GRIT is not quite what you'd expect from the makers of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN and FARGO.  It's not dark, it's not depressing, and there's very little sense of anarchical chaos.  The film is more in line with the spiritual undertones of O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU?, without that film's campy rumpus (or George's Clooney's hair).  It's a serious piece, with dashes of humor, that never takes itself seriously.  It's a more-or-less uplifting tale of challenges and proving your worth.  The film follows young Protestant girl Mattie Ross, whose father has been murdered by Tom Chaney.  Mattie recruits alcholic Marshall Rooster Cogburn; tagging alone for the ride is Texas Ranger LaBoef.  Together, they track down Chaney, face down an evil gang of ne'er-do-wells, and become fast and lasting friends in the process.That's right--this is (almost) family-friend Coen Brothers.  But don't let that deter you.  The Coens inhabit Portis's pretension-vs.-violence world like a second skin.  The film hews closely to the novel, as the Coens did with Cormac McCarthy's NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.  This means that the language feels clunky at first, though coming from Hailee Steinfeld, it feels natural, even poetic.  Steinfeld is a true find--this is her film, and she manages to hold her own against her formidable costars.  That list includes Jeff Bridges, sinking his teeth into the role of Cogburn; Matt Damon, affecting a faux-nonchalance as LaBoef; Josh Brolin, thoroughly menacing (and slightly pitiful) as Chaney; Barry Pepper, absolutely fantastic as gang leader Lucky Ned Pepper; and other actors who've made their way into previous Coen collaborations.  The fact that the three leads were all nominated for major awards (Steinfeld and Bridges for Oscars) says something; the fact that two of the most prominent stars, Barry Pepper and Josh Brolin, take on relatively minor roles, suggests their dedication to such a fine work of cinema.  And you can't ignore the other eight Oscar nominations, either--including Best Screenplay, Best Directing, Cinematography (Roger Deakins, back again), and Motion Picture of the Year.Overall, TRUE GRIT is another Coen Brothers masterpiece.  It's different from their others--this is a Coen film you can take your kids to see.  They'll get a little scared in spots (the film does get intense), but they won't be scarred for life.  But don't let that fool you, or sway you from seeing the film--it's 100% Coen Brothers, another fine work of art in their catalog.\",\n",
              "       \"That isn't to say that I don't appreciate Jolie's talent or enjoy her in more serious fare, but there is something about Angelina that demands your attention, and that attention is never better arrested than when Angelina is drop kicking bad guys and jumping out of moving vehicles.Surround her with explosions and she shines!`Salt' is an interesting film.  On the outset it seems like a generic action adventure film with little merit outside of Jolie's commanding presence.  Instead, what one finds is a remarkably well rounded film that understands the importance of building a story instead of staging a series of random action sequences.  The story presented in `Salt' is an engaging and thought provoking one, and while it is obviously handled in a way that puts the emphasis on the explosions, it doesn't forsake `brains' in the process.`Salt' tells the story of CIA agent Evelyn Salt.  Apparently she's a Russian spy.  This is news to her and soon she is on the run from her former friends and colleagues who want to detain her.  She seems to be mainly concerned for her husband's wellbeing, and of course clearing her name.Twists, turns and a lot of `booms' ensue.The action is top notch here, wonderfully paced to implode in the eardrums and eye sockets of the movie-watching public; and it works great.  Angelina kicks serious booty, and the slick editing makes for a thrilling ride.  I will call caution to the film's constant violent nature.  To be honest, there are many sequences that feel almost too graphic for the film's rating.  I'm shocked that it didn't receive an R rating (that stairway execution scene in particular was very rough).  So, be mindful of the kiddies.  The acting is all what you'd expect from a film in this genre.  I want to say that I really love Liev Schreiber and really wish he'd get better roles.  He has such acting talent (I still cry when I think of his performance in `A Walk on the Moon') but he never gets to really use it.  It appears that he has Peter Sarsgaard syndrome (great actor reduced to stereotypical villain roles).HOLLYWOOD, GIVE THESE MEN BETTER ROLES!!!Alas, there is no real reason to gripe about that here, since the film is elevated with his presence, and I'm happy about that.  In the end I totally recommend this.  It's loud, abrasive and IN-YOUR-FACE, but it has depth of story that is not often found within this genre.Stand up job, if I do say so myself.\",\n",

And what came out in both cases: masterpieces.Yes: he drove his crew to insanity in his search for perfection (I've heard the stories from the men themselves).  But perfection is on display here: perfection in the assemblage of a rogue's gallery of tableaux vivantes illustrating the folly of man.Is it heart warming?  Hardly.  Is it boring?  Depends on you.  Are you boring?  Do you enjoy experiencing great paintings at, say, The Louvre?  How would an afternoon at a Palladian Villa in the Veneto strike you?  Or would you prefer playing Tron, the video game?  (Actually, there might be an overlap, but you get the point).Was Ryan O'Neal a good actor?  Watch Paper Moon and you'll have to say he wasn't half bad.  Here, it doesn't matter.  Kubrick doesn't want actors.  He wants flesh he can xray.And he gets it.  But these are X-rays by candlelight.  And that's magic.The soundtrack was assembled by James Dean's mentor, Leonard Rosenman.

TRUE GRIIT is a strong example of this.  Despite reading the book and seeing the original film version the viewer will likely not be prepared for this version of the Charles Portis novel.  Much of that is in the screenplay as written by Joel and Ethan Coen; the dialogue is definitely not contemporary but is as things might have been uttered during the timeframe of the piece. This adds considerable authenticity and rawness, AND humor to the story.Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld - the weak point in casting) is compelled to bring her father's murderer Tom Clancy (Josh Brolin) to justice. A girl of fixed purpose (and strange knowledge of Latin and law....) she hires US Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), an alcoholic reprobate of a old cuss who has the one attribute Mattie needs - true grit.  The two set out on Clancy's trail, at times assisted by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon, who shines here), chasing Clancy and the gang led by Lucky Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper, hardly recognizable), and after much killing and mangy incidents justice of sorts is served.  The ending of the film gets a bit sappy but leaves the audience a chance to clear heads before the film credits begin.Aside from the terrific dialogue, other attributes of this version of the story include first class acting by all concerned including some exceptional cameos by Ed Corbin as the Bear Man, Domhnall Gleeson as the kid Moon, Jarlath Conroy as the Undertaker and Paul Rae as Emmett Quincy, extraordinary cinematography by Roger Deakins who manages to give the Coen Brothers some spectacular scenery and atmosphere - the Old West the way we've seldom seen it, and a musical score that relies heavily on old Baptist church songs.

Hailee Steinfeld steals the spotlight and is the reason why anybody enjoys this version.  Matt Damon portrays a character (Texas Ranger) that doesn't let him shine as an actor, and as he holds back to let the other main characters have a better shot at the Oscar, it subsequently takes a lot away from how much the viewer enjoys this remake.  One of the trivia details about this film was John Wayne was 62 when he portrayed Rooster Cogburn, whereas Jeff Bridges was 60.  The character is supposed to be 40 yrs of age at the time this story's theme intended.  The redundant song heard over and over is the old hymn Leaning On The Everlasting Arms.  Keep On The Firing Line is another hymn that is part of the soundtrack.  You have to let go of adoration for John Wayne, but even then this film lacks what it SHOULD have been because it seemed Jeff Bridges had a dozen marbles in his mouth 90% of the time he said anything.  Other than that, it is a decent western, and except for a few slow moving parts that at times was a bit tedious, the costuming, sets, and scenery are actually above average.  Some of the FX includes some brutal scenes of violence which is why the movie got the rating it has.  You'll need to try not to compare this 2010 film with the 1969 version.  If you can keep them separate, even though Jeff Bridges needs to fire his coach that instructed him how to talk tough guy US Marshal, I believe you can agree this film deserves at least 3 stars.

The original Wall Street has dated somewhat since its 80's release - go watch it now, and you will more likely be amazed at the hair styles and synth-y soundtrack than the story.  But it was a real zeitgeist movie, doing what Stone can do best - using a storyline in a movie to hold a mirror up to America, even if the angle is not the most flattering one.  This time round though, the edge is gone - the heat of the satire has somehow gone off the boil.  Don't get me wrong, I still found this a good movie and entertaining, but it's more in a melodrama mould than the expose of Stone's former glories.The movie is set in 2008.  Gecko has been released from prison, aged, but impassive enough for us to find it difficult to tell if the experience mellowed him, or embittered him.  Into his life walks Shia Lebeouf, involved in a relationship with his estranged daughter.  Amid the backdrop of one of the most significant year in decades for Wall Street, we follow the relationships of these three, and a few significant others.  Plenty to enjoy on display - Leboeuf puts in a surprisingly decent performance, and age hasn't dulled the glint in Douglas eye.. there is still a tangible presence when he's on centre stage.  Stone has accumulated some other surprising talents too.. Susan Sarandon, Eli Wallach amongst others.. but they exist roles that are entirely dispensible from a story point of view.  Sarandon in particular has a well played role as Laboeuf's mother, which nonetheless does nothing except slow the pace of the movie down.  Perhaps the biggest star then, after Douglas, is Stone himself.  Not in his on screen cameo, but as the director... the film is full of interesting stylistic flourishes and images which make the movie a visual treat.  Alas, when you are noticing director's tricks and enjoying the soundtrack, perhaps it's a good indication the story is not as punchy as it thinks it is.Not a failure, indeed, worth watching - but this fails to capture the moment in the way its predecessor did.\",\n",

It's left to the actors to show us -- a chunk of acting meat any good actor would leap at. (Acting is about embodying the character, not reading the lines.) This necessarily leaves the film open for interpretation. Here's my perspective.Though Euliss Sonny Dewey might honestly feel he has a calling from God, he too-often sees things in terms of how they relate to him and his interests, not God. This is apparent in continually referring to the churches he founds as his churches. When he takes Toosie (Miranda Richardson) out for dinner, his pre-meal grace includes a self-serving thank-you to The Big Fella for the spiritual companionship of a good man and a good woman. Whether Sonny intends to get her into bed isn't clear, but he obviously doesn't understand Jesus's response to the man who called him good Master -- Why callest thou me 'good'?Indeed, like most self-professed Christians, Sonny understands almost nothing about his religion. When Reverend Blackwell tells Sonny that he's experienced two heart attacks while preaching, the issue of why a loving God would so punish a person who was doing His will never comes up. That it makes no sense doesn't seem to cross either's mind.Sonny is as much a fake as Elmer Gantry -- he just doesn't know it. The Christianity he preaches is a lot of noise, failing to convey the practical Christianity Jesus taught and practiced. Sunny's protracted sermon at the end has been criticized as overly long, but its /empty/ length makes clear that Sonny has nothing useful to say. He's little more than a religious entertainer who knows how to please his audience.The characters talk about the Devil making them sin, and God always placing them where they need to be. This effectively denies /any/ responsibility for their behavior. Significantly, there is /no/ point in this film where Sonny explicitly or even implicitly takes responsibility for his actions. It's as if his murdering a man was part of God's Plan for his life, and thus implicitly forgiven. He is never redeemed, because there is no /need/ for redemption. When the police take him away, he asks a pointless question about why they're driving Chevys when most police departments have switched to Fords. Oh, well, I'm always sayin' /something/... Whether divinely inspired or not -- mostly the latter.The Apostle /is not/ a sympathetic portrayal of pentecostal ministers. It is a brilliantly subtle attack on the cheap, theatrical religion they preach. Sonny is likable enough, and often does good -- but when push comes to shove, he breaks the rules of his religion, then makes excuses that appeal to a human sense of how things are or should be. He does not follow in Jesus's footsteps.Though mostly dead-serious, there are several comic scenes, including Sonny's mother (June Carter Cash) pretending to have a seizure. Another is Duvall dragging a geezer alky out of a bar and encouraging him to quit drinking. The last scene reminds me of the last scene of The Producers. (!!!) Max and Leo are selling shares for their new production to the prisoners, and Sonny is doing much the same with his fellow criminals on his work detail -- he's got them participating in a call-and-response.Regardless of how you interpret The Apostle, it's a great film, with one of the finest performances you will ever see at its center. Robert Duvall is arguably the greatest actor this country has yet produced, and unquestionably one of the greatest actors of all time. Watching him act is like watching Fred Astaire dance, or listening to Mozart's music. The LV's liner notes call him the consummate actor -- regarded as peerless by his peers. It is difficult to argue this (though Marlon Brando and Ned Beatty come close).PS: The preceding was written /before/ I viewed the supplemental material on the LV. You may wish to compare and contrast.\",\n",
              "       \"Multi-faceted combination of psychological drama and shoot 'em up with unexpectedly near-hilarious comedy. Ford and Wayne managed to put together a masterpiece at a time in Hollwood and the U.S.A. when a masterpiece was expected...but still treasured.My first complete viewing in 25 years, some of the idea of perfection has waned:the JW That'll be the day is too often repeated, though each time it's in a different setting and Wayne's expression is quite different; we have Paulie accidentally marrying, out on the trail with the Duke, a Native-American, who clownishly follows them, joins them in putting stakes don for the night, but is kicked away the next morning as if she is some drunken interloper. This scene could never be done per se in any imagined 2011 Searchers remake. Edwards seems to enjoy the proceedings and we wonder if that's because of racism or just general insensitivity - a follow-up scene ensures that he is at least not insensitive.At one point, Edwards and Paulie think they may have found Ethan's niece but they inspect a dwelling inhabited by white women driven insane - by a warring tribe, or *any* tribe? In '54, when the book was published, and '56 when the film was released, that was no doubt an unlikely question. Another question is whether Edwards believed, as a Confederate, that Slavery should be a State's right?The comedy is very well handled though a long passage about Paulie's original, long-waiting flame prepared to marry a simple, local dude who lucked out on the rebound,is placed just prior to the climactic action scenes involving the rescue.Viewing this exceptional picture we reflect on the movie title and it's double-meaning. Did Ethan find something more than a long-lost relative? If you will never be convinced tht John Wayne was more than a dependable character actor...see the movie. Interesting that other characters are similarly in conflict: Ward Bond must decide at different times wherher he's a Preacher or a Ranger.. And when he joins Wayne in his search, is he looking for Comanches first, or actually helping Wayne, who he knows has pocketed some spoils of war in the form of fresh, new coinage (something to help him stay on course for five years!).Sensational filmmaking (cinemtaography, editing, musical score with a beautiful theme song by The Sons Of The Pioneers, not with the historical resonance of High Noon by Tex Ritter, but a deeper lyric and more relatable to today).This VHS has a TV Special (with effusive commentary by those who were *there*) on the making of this epic plus the terrific trailor.\",\n",
              "       \"This version of the Terminator narrative is much more sedate, much less driven by the chase, than prior versions; yet it retains important atmospheric qualities.  It features an enemy that our heroes cannot defeat, only outlast.  It maintains T2's fight the future quality, yet emphasizes the original film's keep one step ahead pessimism.  Even Bear McCreary's musical themes utilize emotions built up from the first two films' struggle.But the dense atmospherics signal that this series doesn't just recycle the films.  Whereas the classic originals occur substantially at night, with a gloomy noir ambiance, this series makes contrasts between night and day, as between good and evil.  Even while characters like Derek Reese muddy moral boundaries, this series emphasizes that morality does exist, and we have an obligation to fight for our beliefs and our ethics.The introduction of religious themes, never used in the movies, gives this series a depth not previously plumbed.  Sometimes this gets silly, as when Agent Ellison and Doctor Silverman debate whether Sarah Connor is a prophet.  But it also gives the characters a concrete purpose; they don't just keep fighting because they must, or to prevent hypothetical catastrophe, but because they know the fight is, in itself, right.But this alternate to the fatally absurd T3 marks a powerful switch to the franchise mythology.  Since Terminators still drop into Sarah Connor's life, fate appears inevitable.  There really is a fate other than what we make, Sarah.  Moving Judgment Day from the T2 date to a new timeline requires some adjustment to the prior narrative, yet emphasizes that destiny can only be postponed, not overthrown.  Pretty pessimistic.Therefore this creates a distinct modern mythology, in which morality exists, but God only participates part-time.  Humankind fights for right, but we have only vague parameters, and we define rightness on a situational basis.  Thus different moralities, like Derek Reese's versus Charlie Dixon's, or Agent Ellison's versus Sarah Connor's, assume equal weight, and when they come into conflict, we must subjectively identify which right applies to which situation.Thus, despite utilizing prior Terminator narrative, this series creates an entirely new experience.  Instead of letting social mythology poke through excitement and adrenaline, this show's cerebral, character-driven story gives way to moments of stirring excitement.  It demands that we watch it differently than the films, which have been inconsistent at best.  And it provides rewards that will outlast the show's unfortunately brief network run.\",\n",
              "       \"Polanski has long had a way of turning genre movies on their head, and making tired old scripts seem fresh and cleanly written.  Of course it helps when you start with good material as is the case with Robert Harris'The Ghost Writer, who also co-wrote the script.  The intriguing plot turns nicely on itself, and Polanski keeps you guessing throughout the movie.  Adam Lang, impeccably played by Pierce Brosnan, bears some rather striking resemblances to Tony Blair, but rather than offer some polemic on the illegal renditions that were conducted in Europe, the ghost, finds there is much more to Lang's autobiography than meets the eye.Ewan McGregor brings the viewer into the story, as he tries to finish off a manuscript left behind by a previous ghost writer who was found washed up on a secluded shoreline, not far from the austere beach house of Adam Lang.  The setting may be Martha's Vineyard, but Polanski had to do all his shooting in Denmark and Germany, as he has long been considered persona non grata in the States and Britain.  You get the feeling he is teasing his nemeses, as well as viewers, with this finely scripted drama, as the ghost uncovers juicy bits of information pointing to an unsavory relationship between Lang and the US.  But, these are for the most part carefully conceived distractions, as the real story is locked away in the manuscript, which the ghost eventually unlocks, but finds himself having to pay a heavy price for it.Olivia Williams is excellent as Lang's jaded wife, Ruth, and Kim Catrall is barely recognizable as Lang's administrative secretary.  Like in many of his previous films, Polanski chooses to imply motives rather than broadly state them, leaving the viewer to piece together the underlying stories.  He provides sinister foils and desolate scenes to underscore the menacing tone of this film.  The Ghost Writer seems to float on the edge of the supernatural, thanks to the remote Romo, Denmark, location, like Shakespeare's Hamlet.  Ultimately, the films plays out pretty much as you would expect it too, but not without an Agatha Christie twist in the end.  Good to see, Roman Polanski hasn't lost his touch.\",\n",
              "       \"Kaufman's first movie as both writer and director is full of his trademark strangeness. It's also darkly funny -- sometimes hilariously so -- at times deeply moving, and occasionally quite depressing. After a fairly conventional start the movie gradually creeps into the bizarre as the main protagonist's life becomes entwined with his magnus opus: a monumentally-scaled play reflecting his own life. Caden Cotard battles against mysterious ill-health, desertion by his wife and daughter, his inability to form stable relationships, and the sprawling, leviathan that is his play. As his 1:1 recreation of his world becomes his world, and the decades pass without the play passing the rehearsal stage, Cotard is absorbed, and yet sidelined, by his own creation. Until death finally conjoins (or maybe separates) the man and his work. Kaufman seems to be trying to address many basic human themes. Sometimes he succeeds and sometimes he doesn't, but it's alway fascinating to watch him try. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Cotard, is mesmerising, and is supported by an equally impressive cast. It certainly won't be to everyone's taste, but if you like thought-provoking, off-the-wall cinema this is a must-see.\",\n",
              "       \"For a wild, swashbuckling adventure, within the loose framework of traditional of Greek mythology, it would be pretty hard to top Dreamworks' magnificent thrill-ride, Sinbad - Legend of the Seven Seas (2003).  The film has a terrific story, loaded with daring do, romance, danger, mystery, and historical touchstones.  This is an epic adventure that flows smoothly from place to fabulous place, featuring state of the art animation, stunning cinematography, and superb vocal talent that impart life to the characters, helping to give the archaic figures more modern sensibilities.Put the package together, and you have a movie that is great entertainment for all ages, appealing to the sense of adventure and romance in everyone.  This is a film that while a fanciful fantasy, has a serious life or death undertone, and features characters that are all adults, and who maintain their focus on the mission.  While there is lots of humor and fun, there is little gratuitous silliness.  Even the dog Spike (Frank Welker), is a vital member of the ship's crew.To suit her malevolent purposes, Eris (Michelle Pfeiffer) the ancient goddess of discord, initiates a plan to use the pirate Sinbad (Brad Pitt), to create chaos in the Kingdom of Syracuse, by framing him for the theft of the `Book of Peace'.  When Sinbad is arrested, Proteus (Joseph Fiennes), Son of King Dymas (Timothy West), and childhood friend to Sinbad, volunteers to take his place, to allow Sinbad to venture on a quest to Tartarus, a section of the Underworld, to try and retrieve the book.Sinbad, his first mate Kale (Dennis Haysbert), Spike, and the rest of his crew set out to sea, where they soon discover that the lovely Marina (Catherine Zeta-Jones), Proteus' fianc&eacute; has sneaked aboard.  This becomes a fortuitous development, when the men are bewitched by the spell of the sirens, and Marina with vital aid from Spike, guides the ship past the rocks that threaten to put an early end to their journey.  After escaping a giant fish, and using it to pull them along, they reach an island where they are attacked by the ferocious Roc, a giant snowbird of prey that grabs Marina, and carries her up to the top of a snow-covered mountain.  Sinbad rescues her single-handedly, in a breathtakingly spectacular high G-force ride, sliding down the side of the mountain.Continuing on, the ship approaches the edge of the flat Earth, and continues on to Tartarus, utilizing some innovative sailing techniques.  Sinbad and Marina brave the sandy, arid, and gloomy desolation of Tartarus, and confront the goddess Eris, who has one final test for Sinbad, in order to reclaim the Book of Peace.Incorporating classical themes from mythology, Sinbad - Legend of the Seven Seas mixes action, adventure, sacrifice, danger, romance, and redemption, in an epic struggle to foil the will of a deity.  The technical achievements in animation are impressive, and often stunningly executed.  Spearheaded by Dennis Haysbert, Michelle Pfeiffer, Brad Pitt, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, the vocal talent helps to elevate the production to even higher levels, along with composer Harry Gregson-Williams' majestic score.  Although something of a disappointment commercially, the film is marvelously entertaining, and would be an excellent addition to the collection of adventure lovers of all ages.  The extras include a commentary track, and various bonus features mostly aimed at kids.\",\n",
              "       \"Gene Tierney sheds her golden girl image in Leave Her to Heaven, where she stars as an unstable and very possessive woman who loves a little too much, as Richard Harland soon discovers after marrying her. Leave Her to Heaven was a big hit, and took home some hardware at the 1946 Oscars as proof, although I think at times it suffers from being a little too dreamy. Still, the scenery is breathtaking and picturesque and the mood is excellent and effective, and the actors perform adequately in their roles.While I don't think this is as great of performance as her role in The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, it is unique to see Tierney changing it up and playing the villain, Ellen Berent Harland. She has a quiet, vindictive way about her, as her visions of perfect marriage are ruffled up a bit with visits from family and in-laws and Richard's time-consuming job as an author. She has to have things her way, or it might get a little unpleasant for others, although quite a bit of time passes before we see her true side. She takes matters in her own hands, including an eerie scene with her out in the lake with Richard's nephew Danny. As other reviewers have said, this is a scene that defines her coldness and callousness. Before other possessive unbalanced females graced the screen in films such as Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct, there was Ellen Berent.The film also provides some memorable, unforgettable lines. I love the one with Ellen and her sister Ruth after Ellen's true colors have been revealed. Ellen is attempting to antagonize and bully good girl Ruth, and Ruth's response: I don't envy you--I'm sorry for you. You're the most pitiful creature I've ever known. There is also a dramatic trial at the end of the film. While the trial seems a bit over-the-top and ridiculous at points, Vincent Price, a lawyer who stars as Ellen's former love, provides fantastic tension toward the film's conclusion, as several key stars take the stand.The disc also has an optional commentary from the director, as well as a quick look into the 1946 Oscars.\",\n",
              "       \"Inspired by director Amy Heckerling's imagined dialogue for her then-infant daughter, this lively comedy proves to be an engaging piece from beginning to end.In the New York City of the late 1980s, an attractive young accountant named Molly(Kirstie Alley)begins an affair with a married client named Albert(George Segal), resulting in the conception of an infant son to be named Mikey(portrayed by Jason Schaller, Jaryd Waterhouse, Jacob Haines, and Christopher Aydon, and voiced by the irrepressable Bruce Willis).Prior to the discovery of her pregancy, we see the illicit relationship progress, and find Molly spying on her lover and his family with her reluctant co- worker, Rona( Twink Caplan) in tow.Molly's parents( Olympia Dukakis and Louis Heckerling) are a constant in their daughter's life, as she visits them frequently.But Molly is insecure in this relationship in which her baby's father keeps making empty promises, and one day, while in a clothing store with Rona, she discovers Albert's affair with his interior designer, Melissa(Joy Boushel), and the shock of this discovery causes her to go into labor.Deprived of a cab on her first attempt to hail one, she is given a lift to the hospital by a cab driver named James(John Travolta, on the verge of renewing the level of popularity he enjoyed in the '70s), who is  mistaken for the father, and hustled into the delivery room.Little Mikey, who had an immensely fun time in the prenatal stages, is traumatized and confused by his entrance into the world. While appreciative of his mother's embrace, the baffled newborn pensively ponders his confusion about his new whereabouts while sucking a pacifier.Around him are many crying nursery mates.Realizing her mistake in bringing her new son into the world under the circumstances in which he came into it, Molly vows to find her young son the best father she can find for him.We find Molly and son back at their apartment. James tracks them down to return Molly's purse, and vows to babysit for Molly on her evenings out.As James begins to bond with the precocious infant, Molly has a series of unsuccessful dates, and finally confronts Albert, attempting one last time to get him to take responsibility for the son he brought into the world.In return for his help, Molly helps James deal with his grandfather (Abe Vigoda), as he relocates to a new nursing home.Interspersed with all this are Mikey's thoughts as he  lives, loves, laughs, gets into mischief, ultimately playing Cupid and helping his Mom find happiness.I admire the realism in showing Molly paying consequences for her affair, but in this witty tale, filled with a lot of heart, we feel glad that the best outcome for these flawed but likeable people prevails.\",\n",
              "       \"The King's Speech strings together jewel-like sequences like beads on a chain, such that the moviemaking and ensemble acting on view is perhaps stronger than significane of the historical event depicted, though the importance of kingly speeches during war is not to be dismissed.On first viewing, The King's Speech falls into the category of a historical British import, in the spirit of the Merchant-Ivory offerings of the 1980s and 1990s, with older versions of Merchant-Ivory ensembles -- Derek Jacoby as the archbishop of Canterbury, Helena Bonham Carter as Bertie's wife, Timothy Spall as Churchill, and so forth. You settle back for the plot to unfold, and as the Colin Firth notes (paraphrasing) on the DVD extras, to whit: Prince meets speech therapist, prince loses speech therapist, prince regains speech therapist.On second viewing, the beautiful construction of the film becomes apparent. We have no chronological jumps. Each sequence is self-contained and flows into the next. We start with an innocent enough event: Bertie (Colin Firth), the son of King George V, needs to give a speech to close an exhibition at Wembley. He walks with the good cheer of a condemned man down corridors, up a stairs and out to the terrace to address the waiting multitudes. He stammers and pauses and creates discomfort and fidgeting in the audience. Unknown to him, and to the viewer at this early juncture in the audience, an Australian actor with success in helping stammerers is in onlooking crowd. And his son is going to lean over and ask him, Do you think you can help that man?Bertie, who would later become King George VI, didn't have any inkling that he would in effect have to stand up to Hitler and help Winston Churchill rally a nation. His wife, Elizabeth, the mother of Princesses Elizabeth and Ann, finds Lionel Logue, a speech therapist and not the first, to help her husband. She's unaware of the machinations of the head of the therapist society to have Logue's name advanced to help Bertie. Her timing is fantastic, as history is about to require a more brave if less eloquent ascender to the throne than Bertie's brother Edward, who would eventually abdicate to marry Wallis Simpson.Along the way, we have fantastic casting at every corner: Australian Geoffrey Rush as Logue, Michael Gambon as Bertie's father, George V; the finest actors of the British stage of the last two generations appear here. Finely honed scriptwriting brings us peak scenes as when Logue says sternly, My game, my turf, my rules to the prince on his first testy visit, as Logue tries to establish trust and total equality in the safety of my consultation room. Firth skillfully establishes Bertie's pride, disarming charm and difficult side when he blurts one of my many faults! when Logue calls him on his temper.Sets are intriguing: Logue's house has explosive and strange merled painting on the walls, and the young princesses Ann and Elizabeth a stableful of wooden horses in a scene of comforting domesticity. The BBC's broadcasting station feeds royal speeches to every corner of empire, with wire boxes labeled Antigua, Kenya and so forth. A stroll in Regent's Park is London as a fairy tale.A subtheme in the film is the role of family: Bertie tells a charming tale of a penguin to his daughters, complete with subtle wit, improvisation and stammer. Logue is an equally engaged father, who plays guess the Shakespeare play with his boys (Time for Shakes, Dad?). These domestic scenes contrast with Bertie's confession to Logue that he was closest to his nannies, but not the first, who pinched him and did not feed him, a deficiency not noted by his parents for three years.The core of the movie of course are the sparks that fly as Logue tries to cut down a prince to be his equal, and Bertie fights back fiercely, over everything from whether Bertie can smoke in Logue's office to whether first names are acceptable. There's subtle drama as Bertie reads Shakespeare while wearing headphones that blast music to calm his tongue. The two fight stormily and make up. Once back on track learning the tricks of public speaking, Bertie attempts strenuous exercises, including rolling on the carpet, to learn how to relax the body, diaphragm and throat.Logue carries secrets that come to light after digging by the appalled archbishop, but he staunchly defends his methods and himself with great aplomb. With so many beautiful scenes here, multiple viewings may be rewarding. The King's Speech serves as a primer on moviemaking and learning from history, without an explosion or CGI effect in sight; or perhaps only a few, such as rendering crowd scenes at Wembley and outside Buckingham Palace.The film has peaks when Bertie and Logue first meet, when Logue roars back a defense when the king's associates attack him, and when Bertie -- prepped and morally supported by Logue -- makes a pivotal speech when England declares war on Nazi Germany. Enjoy each scene unfurling as Bertie finds a second friend -- to equal the friendship with his wife - in his evolution from lonely lad to competent king.\",\n",
              "       \"Jackie Chan's first major American breakthrough remains his most energetic, entertaining spectacle. The film's storyline is a joke, with supposedly hardcore Bronx motorcycle gangs coming off like characters in a Saturday morning cartoon, but that's clearly not the point. The plot's only there to fill the space between fight scenes with a few randomly connected antagonizing situations, and in many instances its complete lack of any connection with reality is actually quite charming. The real focus, naturally, is on Chan's inventive use of his surroundings and blistering hand speed during his frequent clashes with gaudily-dressed bikers and, later on, suit-and-sunglasses adorned g-men. Regardless of locale, Jackie is somehow able to find an unsuspecting prop, then quickly put it to use in bludgeoning somewhere in the range of a dozen different combatants in wildly original ways, keeping audiences surprised and indulged. A kindergarten-grade story won't win this rumble any awards, but as a vehicle for its star's own inimitable style of celluloid-friendly martial arts it's perfect.\",\n",

The seventies idea was to establish every charactor with enough pathos so that the audience would become frenetic as to who should live or painfully die. Earthquake gets there, but to a somewhat lesser degree than other disaster flicks of noteriety.So, Ava Gardner looks as bad as her charactor is inside, that works. Good old Charlton Heston is tailor made(no pun intended)as the heroic young as* grabber of Ms. Boujold. Seventies cinematic taboo well placed. For the era, the twisted manglings of LA(baby)look passable enough to hold the film. George Kennedy's wild eyed cop is right on target as we all remember his deserved stare-down of Victoria Principles ti*s. I'm waiting for the blu ray to really judge the famous sensorround that loses punch on a standard DVD. It's all a bit soapy at times but a fun scene is just around the corner- maybe cool Miles Quade's play on Evil Knieval...or rooting for the boring rookie seismologist who knows more than the department combined. And ah yes-my then ten year old theatre going mind still has the trigger-happy weekend warrior emblazoned in it. What red blooded boy didn't want to save Ms. Principle?Some nice retro cameoes if you really dig into the movie. The ending is thoughtful. I'll always remember Hestons big decision in the sewer pipe. He went for the hard choice! The film screams a blu ray release which I know is on the horizon- it's been a long time coming for this fan. Earthquake is a heavy dose of unintended nostalgia that should rub you right if you understand the world of Hollywood at that time (and embrace it). Walter Matthou is still worth the watch as your brain shouts, CORNY!. Fun and subtley provacative. Go for it.\",\n",
              "       \"When it debuted in the winter of 1989, this sequel's wide-eyed portrait of the future was so ambitious and dramatic that it was tough to look beneath the surface. Today, a mere four years removed from the distant year 2015 depicted on the screen, those predictions seem more like a creative writing essay from the science fiction magazines of the 1950s. They remain endearing and entertaining, but in a different way - the jokes still work, but the more serious elements either don't play or, worse, come off as pure camp. And, with the shiny veneer of that potential future relegated to nothing more than a running series of sight gags, the holes and flaws of the plot itself find themselves stripped bare. It came as something of a shock to me, given my fond memory, but this really is not a good film. What screen time the cast doesn't spend breathlessly explaining the plot (which is, perhaps, fifty percent of the film) is devoted to revisiting several of the best scenes from the first movie, rather than creating fond memories of their own. It's an overly elaborate story, unashamedly building to the simultaneously-filmed follow-up, that has neither the steady pace nor the genuine charm of the original. Plot holes the size of a steam engine are the least of its concerns, given that the first film managed to be such a success in spite of similar problems.\",\n",
              "       \"This warm attempt at a traditional big-hearted comedy has its awkward moments, but it's a generally positive attempt to make people laugh through silliness.  Moreover, it uses the Marx Brothers' classic outsider ethos, throwing its sympathy behind misfits and oddballs instead of the people who want you to know they're too cool for the room.  This creates a rebellious tone we see too seldom in this age of slick hipsterism.Tim (Paul Rudd) wants in with the in crowd at his cutthroat office, and his boss reveals what that takes: joining his weekly exhibitionistic dinner where the well-heeled mock eccentrics, cranks, and humbugs.  Tim runs quite literally into Barry (Steve Carrell), who makes mice dioramas and misunderstands subtle social cues.  But Tim's promotion may kill his romance with Julie (Stephanie Szostak).  So Tim and Barry coach the eccentrics to rebel.Rudd wings straight lines at Carrell, who returns strange zingers and non-sequiturs.  It's mostly in good fun, except occasional scenes that suggest attempted rape is funny if a woman victimizes a man, or that dismemberment is funny if the victim is established as scummy.  These lapses in taste do bring the tone down, but overall, this movie maintains an optimistic, playful feel as Rudd and Carrell wind each other up.On the whole, this generally okay comedy will not change the cinema landscape much.  It provides an all-star comedy cast an opportunity to push each other to the next level, and it certainly won't harm anybody's career.  I'd call this a straightforward, brainless evening's entertainment.  Its air of silliness and play will appeal if you want brainless laughter, and you'll probably repeat your favorite lines around the water cooler tomorrow.\",\n",
              "       \"Apart from the special effects disaster that is the mirror scene, Poltergeist delivers one of the most effective, engrossing, and eerie presentations in movie history.  Who can ever get the ill-fated Heather O'Rourke's They're here line or the fantastic performance of the diminutive Zelda Rubenstein as the psychic house cleaner Tangina?  JoBeth Williams, for her part, turns in a fantastic performance, cementing her position as the emotional center of the story.  Heck, everyone involved did a great job with this movie, including the dog.  I'm often critical of Tobe Hooper's directing, but there is no doubt that Poltergeist represents his finest directorial work (although rumor has it that producer/co-writer Steven Spielberg did more than his share of the directing job).I'm not sure why they called this film Poltergeist because the goings-on in the Freeling house go way, way beyond typical poltergeist activity.  Things start out small (chair stacking, objects moving on their own, utensils bending on their own), but it doesn't take long for things to get completely out of hand.  Initially, though, the stage is set with the typical fears most all of us experienced as children - fear of the dark, the closet, something under the bed, thunder storms, stuffed toys that suddenly become creepy when the lights are out.  Fortunately for most of us, those fears are just childish fancies.  The same cannot be said for the Freeling children.  Unable to go to the police with their story (yes, officer, we think our lost daughter is somewhere in the house and we can still communicate with her through the television from time to time), the Freelings call upon local paranormal researchers for help.  Needless to say, this blows the socks off of every other case they've investigated, leaving them no choice but to call in reinforcements in the form of a short but formidable medium (Rubenstein).  Then, just when you think things are under control, the movie ratchets things up to new heights of action and suspense.Poltergeist definitely has the potential to frighten some viewers, with scare tactics ranging from the small and subtle to the unbelievably grandiose - and even the most over-the-top occurrences work in the context of the presentation.  No stranger to large special effects budgets, Spielberg made sure that all of the visual effects were believable (including the use of real human skeletons in one scene) and added to the suspense of the story (except that mirror scene, which really does feature some of the worst special effects I've ever seen in my life).  Not having seen this movie in many, many years, I had forgotten just how impressive it was.  It features some of the best interaction of actors with special effects that I've ever seen, making it easy to keep suspending your disbelief in the face of the most incredible of circumstances.  You even get a sense of resolution at the end, which is something you rarely find in horror movies today.  Poltergeist is, without doubt, a classic in every sense of the word.I would be remiss if I didn't also mention the Poltergeist curse (a result, some say, of using real skeletons in the movie), which adds yet another layer to the atmosphere of the film.  As most people know, Heather O'Rourke died tragically at the age of 12, but it's easy to forget that her co-star Dominique Dunne (daughter of novelist Dominick Dunne) was murdered by her ex-boyfriend within months of the film's release.  Of course, the curse doesn't seem to have affected Craig T. Nelson, who went on to have a long and successful acting career.  You can't help but feel sad, though, watching cute and talented little Heather O'Rourke, knowing that she died so young.\",\n",

He's also directed his fair share of bad movies and My Soul to Take falls into that category as it is predictable and almost amateurish compared to many of his other films.The premise itself wouldn't be so bad except even for a horror film it has too many coincidences and implausible plot points. It's as if Craventook a mental vacation while directing this film forgetting everything he learned from ALL the films he's directed and many of the missteps here are what I would expect from a first time writer/director. Many of the shots are clumsy in both set up and execution and the exposition isn't handled very well either with most plot points telegraphed as if the audience had an I.Q. of 50.The Blu-ray looks quite nice with a solid looking presentation. The problem for many people will be the fact that this is a flipper disc. Didn't Universal learn from their past mistake using dual layered, flipper discs? They weren't popular, prone to problems that occurred due to the pressing process, easier to damage and, in general, a bad format idea. I hope tha this horrible format bites the dust and soon.I also have to wonder WHY this was shown in 3D? None of the shots take advantage of the format and it clearly was just a move to capitalize on the popularity of the format at the time.Audio sounds fine throughout.The special features are underwhelming as well with stars Max Thieriot, John Magaro, Emily Meade and director Wes Craven discussing the making of the film and oblivious to how bad it is. We also get about 20 minutes of deleted scenes, two alternate endings and an alternate opening for the film. None of these would have improved the film which has the premise for a solid TV episode (if not for the implausible elements which continue to build throughout the film)and a predictable whodunnit element.My Soul to Take is an awful horror film lacking any thrills and, at times, it looks like it was written and directed by someone who doesn't understand the genre at all.Skip it.A serial killer suffering from dissocative personality disorder (misidentified as schizophrenia in the film which is a DIFFERENT condition)ends up killing his wife before being shot by police. He disappears after being rushed to the hospital after making a vow tha the would return to kill any children born on that night. His daughter survives.It is suggested that, perhaps, his soul would inhabit one of the seven babies born the night he died.16 years later someone is killing those teenagers born on that night using the MO of the Riverton Ripper (as he was called)and many of the clues suggest it could be Bug (Max Theiriot)who also appears to suffer from multiple personalities as well.\",\n",

Ian Bannan, a Scottish actor, once referred to Deborah Kerr as that lassie frae Helensburgh; a posh town near Glasgow. Her performance is something to behold, particularly in the confines of a nun's habit. Consequently, the acting is often like in the silent movies; sudden head movement and expressive eyes, captured in the camera. Jean Simmons (an English rose in normal life) is a revelation in her role. It's as if the House of Women, as the palace was once known, is affecting some of the nuns. The photography and the colour are stunning (Jack Cardiff). Mr Dean (David Farrar) is a strong, masculine presence. He is uncouth at times yet strangely sympathetic to the nuns' plight. There is love; both unrequited (the worst kind) and acknowledged, with such gentleness and from a surprising source. It's a stunning film!Ian Hunter.Author of `e-Love'.\",\n",

This, along with many of the ideas of Rollerball, is where we are headed (and in many ways have already reached) with our corporate dominated, Kindle-infused media landscape -- where millions of unsuspecting minds are filled with meaningless, violent, cheap imagery and sucked dry of any nuance or culture.  The film deserves to be seen for this alone.  It's leagues better than Logan's Run or other big budget Sci-Fi that came around its time.Unfortunately, Rollerball is a frustrating film on a number of levels.  For one thing, Norman Jewison's directing is uninspired, imitative, and plodding.  James Caan does not seem to know what to do with himself, nor do most of the rest of the cast.  The plot craps out in the second act and then barely recovers for the climax...but the damage is already done.  And then of course there is the mediocre art direction and sound design, which is not nearly imaginative enough.  Just compare this film to the work that directors like Kubrick and Lucas did with similar material and similar (if not lower) budgets.Rollerball would seem like pure genius if it were made today, and you have to give it credit for its vision of a highly polarized world dominated by corporate cynicism and a citizenry turned to human puppets.  Too bad it does not populate this world with compelling characters or a plot worthy of its intentions.  Honestly, with better direction, sound design, art direction, and a couple of rewrites this could have been an amazing film.  There's a reason it's not more highly regarded.\",\n",

And most of the showy style tricks work with the excesses of thestory.OK, sometimes the style is self-concious, and some elements are too familiarand on the nose (Faye Dunaway and Swoozie Kurtz as boozy moms who choose notto see how screwed up their kids are, the extra shallow treatment of the gay character.etc).While I understand how some could be repulsed, personally I thinkthis deserved better than it got from most critics.

Or too young and full of theory to fully realize what something like this could quickly turn into.The story line is very good, the dialog excellent, but if you haven't got a strong - very strong- stomach for violence, this may not be for you.  I had to turn away on some of it, but that's just me.  It's about a diamond heist planned and synchronized down to the gnat's tooth by a set of rogues who have performed successfully many times before in this line of work;  headed up by a patriarch master mind who is grooming his son as second-in-command; the kid has inherited all of his his dad's outlaw mentality and guts but not nearly enough of his brains to go with it.  It's hard to figure.  You are ripped out of a complacent beginning to see things go south almost immediately and thereby is the interesting concept of the whole story:  it begins up front as though it will be continuous, revealing the differing personalities of the gang of thieves as they converse over coffee and crumpets with the usual high/low banter.  Then, it begins to go backward, showing the prior circumstances of each player and how they signed up and why - all intricately tied together as it progresses.  Names are never revealed between the men for the obvious reasons; instead, the old Godfather personally assigns each man a Mr. Color - along with his pep talk - that will be his code name.  Mr. White, Mr. Orange, etc.  Everybody but Mr. Pink is satisfied with their color.

              "       \"LA PIANISTE (THE PIANO TEACHER) goes places most film makers dare not tread - the dark aspects of frustrated sexuality where desire and affection cannot meet. In brief, this is the story of the inner world of an exceptional pianist and piano teacher who lives with her mother in a 'marriage arrangement' that appears to satisfy both with its accompanying fights, jealousies, cheatings, and clingings. This cold pianist (incomparably portrayed by the fine Isabelle Huppert) is absorbed by Schubert and Schumann and shares many of those composers' tendencies towards madness and melancholy. Her private acting out of her sexual life includes forays into pornography video booths, drive-in movies for voyeurism, and other sadomasochistic practices that leave her frustrated in her drive to be humiliated and beaten. Into this sad woman's life enters a sensuously handsome student (again, played with complete credibility and finesse by Benoit Magimel) and much of the film is a hard driving match between lust/desire and need/repulsion, the true approach/avoidance conflict.The pace of the film is so correct for a story about the extended periods of ennui between moments of exhilaration that mirror the life inside a music academy. We are treated to some wonderful Schubert, Schumann, Schonberg, and Bach that serves as the 'dialogue' during extended scenes where the piano teacher listens with her eyes and ears and distorted mind, reacting to the music in equal parts with the performing students. Yes, this is a disturbing film, but it is not a grotesque film. Director Michael Haneke manages to place this surreal sexual tragedy for us to understand just how wide the bell curve of human sexuality stretches. An astonishingly fine film - if you are open to explore the dark interstices of the human mind without prejudice. An added feature of an interview on the DVD with Isabelle Huppert about the character she portrays is exceptionally apropos and well filmed. Grady Harp, July 11\",\n",

Face-plant after face-plant he went down, floor by floor, and finally persevered, picking himself up off the floor pushing a button to bring him back up to the penthouse where a new script awaits.The plot and setting is incredibly simple: An elevator with five passengers gets stuck between floors.  One of the passengers is the devil.  Guess who it is.The execution of this movie is nearly flawless.  When lights flicker, danger is present.  Death will almost certainly ensure.  Figuring out who is responsible for the deaths is what makes the movie interesting.  With each guess the viewer must contradict preconceived notions and attempts to rationalize why someone is or is not the killer.  Anyone who says they watched this movie and figured it all out without the red herrings and strawmen causing doubt is lying.  A detective is introduced to help expedite the investigation.  Aimless at first, he begins to piece together details about each of the elevator's occupants.  His journey serves as both enlightenment during dark and distraction during light.  The fear from each of the passengers relates to the basic claustrophobia we all have, but, more importantly, intermittently takes away two of the passengers' senses (sight & speech).  With each minute they are stuck, the passengers' terror get increasingly more palpable until they're tighter than a snare drum.  Squeezing coal into diamonds.Through director John Dowdle's deft touch, Devil takes viewers on a thrilling and twisting mental discovery.  A journey in which first and second thoughts are questioned.  A classic who'dunit where perception distorts reality like funhouse mirrors.  Aside from an anticlimactic ending (an trademark of M.

Personally, I don't know what to make of this film.  It frustrates and annoys me and yet I found it absolutely absorbing, something I couldn't turn away from, even at its lowest ebb.  At all times it is entertaining.  But it is also manipulative, filled with stock character types rather than genuine people, and a story that is obvious; nothing truly surprised me about this film.  And yet, I still liked it.  I'm trying to figure out why.The opening sequence is magical in its simplicity and beauty.  It gives one pause to wonder.  Unfortunately, how and why we wonder is soon taken away from us by a story that literally maps out exactly what we should feel, when, and why.  Allowing us to arrive at our own conclusions was taken away, I find that galling and not a little insulting.  I was also put off by the heavy handed way in which religion was presented (making Christians either lunatics or self-righteous nitwits).  This was less a story about discovery and more about the politics that might surround such an incredible occurrence.  All the fringe ugliness dampened whatever enthusiasm would be inherent in such a life altering moment.  This is a great idea, mishandled.  Why the botched contact moment?  Why all the nastiness with James Woods maniacal character?  If you want to tarnish and kill an ending, that's the way to do it!On the other hand....there is that magnificent performance by Jodie Foster (and Jena Malone) as Dr. Eleanor Arroway.  John Hurt was bizarre (in a good way) as the mysterious S.R. Hadden.  It was so nice to see David Morse play something other than a bad guy, the same goes for William Fichtner.In the end, I find myself justifying why I liked this movie in spite of all its negative points (that would include Jake Busey & Rob Lowe).  I think that what I liked most was the notion that this could be possible, and wouldn't it be great if it was.

              "       \"Morning Glory seems like a despicable film.  It's the brainchild of seasoned rom-com pro Aline Brosh McKenna, who was also responsible for writing Laws of Attraction, with Pierce Brosnan and Julianne Moore, The Devil Wears Prada, with Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway, and 27 Dresses, with Katherine Heigl.  McKenna knows what makes today's Hollywood rom-coms, but more importantly, she knows what gets today's rom-coms made.  Morning Glory is a well-constructed script: it follows the tried-and-old formula of the modern rom-com, while also leaving the possibility of snagging big talent (and thus a bigger audience)--in this case, Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford.Rachel McAdams stars as a 28-year-old working for a New Jersey morning show, who's dreamed of getting into big-time broadcast journalism since she was 8.  She gets fired from her Jersey morning show and receives a brutally cold lecture from her mother, but she immediately begins a desperate search for a new job.  She gets one, by impressing a big-wig exec played by Jeff Goldblum: she's the new executive-producer on the cruddy morning show Daylight.  There's no need to waste time explaining what happens from there, or the challenges she faces.  One can see it coming.What I didn't see coming was McKenna's wrong-mindedness.  Harrison Ford plays a Walter-Cronkite-quality news anchor who gets fired and winds up contractually bound to Daylight.  He insists on covering real news stories, things of national or international importance.  He's supposed to seem an a--hole for doing so, for not providing the trivial, superficial entertainment Daylight viewers expect.  McAdams informs him that the battle between entertainment and news is over: Entertainment won.  Are we supposed to laugh at the declaration?  How can any intelligent person see Ford's ideas as being that of an old fuddy-duddy, as McKenna does?McAdams' character's achievement is raising the ratings for Daylight and turning it into a show about which people care.  She does so by transforming the show into an entertainment hour, in which the weather forecaster is forced to endure a new rollercoaster or skydiving and Diane Keaton's character has to sumo wrestle and kiss a frog.  She's raised the ratings, which makes her some kind of success, and that's nice because Rachel McAdams is a likable actor--but she's done so by shirking journalistic duty for sensational, goofy entertainment.  Why would we applaud this?McKenna's script just gets more simple-minded from there.  Characters have sudden, inexplicable changes of heart, for the sake of convenient plotting.  She spends an hour showing us how stubborn and obnoxious Ford's character can be, then gives him an apparently complete turnaround in 15 minutes.  We get a nice shot of McAdams' character's mother, the insensitive, cruel one, proudly hanging a news clipping about McAdams' success.  Why do we care?  Does this really make us happy?  She isn't proud of McAdams: she's proud of McAdams' success.Why is McAdams' character attracted to Patrick Wilson's lazy upper-level magazine series journalist?  McKenna tells us it's because he puts up with her, but aren't there tens of thousands of men in the world who would be willing to put up with McAdams' character, let alone McAdams herself?  Isn't it possible someone might not just tolerate the character, but love her for her drive or her eccentricities--you know, the human stuff?Not in McKenna's manufactured world, which fortunately has little to do with life as I know it.  Rom-coms are usually devoid of characters or storylines with human quality, since the genre itself relies on superficial targets to elicit its audience's pleasure.  But they can still be lively (Bridget Jones's Diary), or clever (anything by Judd Apatow), or even meaningful (Definitely, Maybe).  Morning Glory is none of the above.  It's as familiar as the formula of Sesame Street, without such good intentions.  It seems as though one owns the piano score on a dozen different soundtrack CDs.There is one redeeming feature of Morning Glory (although there should be two: Diane Keaton is surprisingly misused): Harrison Ford, whose performance is unfathomably fun, funny, and emotional considering the shallowness of the material.  Hollywood is really enjoying itself, milking Mr. Ford for his Grumpy Old Man quality, but in this movie, his sulking curmudgeonly performance makes all the difference in the world--the world being the thing about which Morning Glory doesn't know a thing, nor care.\",\n",

No Basil Pouledouris score or Jost Vocano cinematography this time around either.  Instead, we get a preteen homicidal maniac,  unbelievably creepy sexual / bestial innuendos, and Leonard Roseman's rehashed Star Trek IV soundtrack. There are some truly monstrous ideas locked in Robocop 2 -- particularly in the creation of a drug-fiend villainous robot...but it's all jumbled by schizophrenic direction, a derivative plot, and cardboard characters.  Kershner's take seems cheap and exploitative, but at times brilliantly inspired -- momentarily breaking through with the gallows humor which made the first film so successful.Robocop 2 still works as an inferior genre piece, thanks to the brilliant template laid down by Paul Verhoeven. It also is a tour-de-force of traditional stop motion animation which surpasses the original film's work on a purely technical level.  For Phil Tippet fans, it doesn't get much better -- and is in a different league from the crap pumped out by CGI sweatshops these days.

As for the musical numbers, I couldn't take my eyes off them! These numbers must be some of the very best ever recorded on film. The movie was not filmed in widescreen but it didn't have to be-this film is all THAT good. The choreography, cinematography and overall design enhance this masterpiece and the musical score works perfectly, too.The film starts with an acting team from the silent era of motion pictures, Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) showing up for the Hollywood premiere of The Young Rascal; it's yet another one of their silent films that makes the crowds gasp in awe. Their movies studio, Monumental Pictures) tells the public that they're in love for publicity; and even Lina believes it although Don knows it's not true! Don's pal and colleague, Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) is also there but Don, ever the ham, takes the microphone and the spotlight and indulges in some fantasy when asked about their past in the world of entertainment. All this happens while Lina remains completely silent--and actually, she's quiet for good reason, too--her voice is actually this screeching, high pitched, nails down a chalkboard experience that is better left unheard; and so Monumental Pictures' chief R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell) lets Don do all the talking at public appearances.Things change fast, though, when their latest film being produced, The Dueling Cavalier, must be changed into a talkie. They all bemoan Warner Brothers' success with The Jazz Singer; and they wonder how on Earth they'll ever get around the fact that Lina's voice is terrible to listen to even if she is beautiful. However, it's not hopeless: Don, Cosmo and Kathy Selden (a young aspiring actress) devise a plan to make The Dueling Cavalier into a musical which will be renamed The Dancing Cavalier. Moreover, they have another plan which is to dub Kathy's great voice for Lina's--but without Lina knowing it so she won't be tempted to have Kathy fired.Things can go pretty much in several different directions from here; and that of course is how everything eventually plays out--but I won't spoil it for you in case you don't know the rest of the plot yet! Suffice it to say that you'll be very entertained with numbers like Donald O'Connor's Make `Em Laugh and The Broadway Melody. Look also for Cyd Charisse dancing with Gene Kelly and a young Rita Moreno plays Zelda Zanders as the movie playfully pokes fun at Clara Bow, the It Girl.The two DVD set comes with wonderful bonus features. There's an optional running commentary with Debbie Reynolds and others; and the second DVD has two superlative documentaries, Musicals Glorious Musicals about what was called The Arthur Freed Unit at MGM and What a Glorious Feeling about the making of Singing in the Rain. We also get clips of musical numbers from Singing in the Rain as they originally appeared in previous films.Singing in the Rain is clearly one of the best musicals ever produced; it's a must-have for any fan of musicals. Even people who don't like musicals will be humming along with the music! Fans of the actors will also want this for their collections.\",\n",

Not that there isn't fertile ground for exploration along these lines; Eastwood's isolated, closed-minded widower could have been an excellent vehicle for prodding a number of inherent stereotypes present in modern American suburbia. Instead of meeting those issues head-on, though, it spends most of its time stalking up and down the sidelines and, often, reinforcing the kind of bull-headed resistance to different cultures that, at the outset, it seemed ready to confront. I had a hard time accepting any of this film's main players as anything more than thin caricatures, especially considering the bland, straightforward dialog they're given to work with, and that resulted in a major emotional disconnect during the climax. Eastwood's jaded war veteran never seems to move completely beyond his biases and, shamefully, the film's resolution only serves to prove him right.

Information on the CD leads them to Osbourne who declines to pay them for the CD so they visit the Russian Embassy as an option.  Linda and Chad decide they need more of Osbourne's secrets to enhance their 'valuable CD'. Bounce to another sidebar:  Linda's boss Ted (Richard Jenkins) likes her, and Harry's wife leaves for a book tour. The CIA (JK Simmons) is involved and the 'conspiracy' continues to blossom - all so that Linda can have plastic surgery to enhance her status on the Internet dating sites while her partner Chad just plods along in his own oblivious style for the ride.  Looking for a meaningful interconnected plot? Good luck!The film lacks sensitive editing that would make it easier to follow the myriad subplots but then that is part of the Coen style.  The dialogue is full of puns - embarrassingly so - and instead of trying to make the film make sense it is better to just sit back and let the silliness of human foibles entertain. That is probably why so many of our top film actors sign on for Coen brothers film - to have fun and poke fun at not only the world we live in but also at us.  Grady Harp, August 11\",\n",

              "       \"Don't be fooled by the opening narration. '(500) Days of Summer' is very much a love story. Just not the kind we're used to seeing.Come to think of it, the title's also a little misleading. This is really the story of Tom Hanson, and the 500 days he spends being in love with Summer. But while we get to know Tom very well, thanks in large part to a charming and nuanced portrayal by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, by the end of the movie Summer remains something of an enigma, right down to Zooey Deschanel's last sly smile.Since this movie is really about Tom and his experiences with (and without) Summer, that works just fine. Besides, '(500) Days of Tom' just doesn't sound as cool.'(500) Days of Summer' gets a lot of credit, though, for making a real attempt at being honest, both with its audience and its characters. Tom and Summer are not cardboard cutouts fit into a standard romance storyline. They challenge the gender stereotypes we often see in movies, and they feel like real people, with their faults and their hangups and their silliness.Only occasionally does the movie dip into the deep well of the trite situation (i.e. an overplayed scene in a record shop or the drunk buddy who says too much), but these are mostly forgivable in a movie with sudden, unexpected bursts of pure inspired fun, like a scene in which Tom feels on top of the world (guess why) and everything around him is made for his delight. If you haven't seen this already, I won't ruin it by trying to summarize it, but it makes the whole movie worth seeing. In fact, just go watch it now.Ok, you're back? Good. Told you it was awesome.'(500) Days of Summer' unfolds as a series of memories played out of sequence. Don't worry about getting lost, though, as each new memory is labeled so you know at least roughly where it falls, and the movie quickly finds its rhythm so the numbers are almost unnecessary. I love this aspect of the movie, as it feels like someone who is reliving the highs and lows of the relationship as they relate to how he felt about it, at the time and now. There's a subtlety about how the subjectivity of memory is conveyed here that I admire.Overall, this is a sharply honest, delightfully quirky, and mostly original movie about love. It reminds me mostly of one of my favorites: 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,' which is even more striking and original in its approach. Both movies, though, share the perspective that love and romance are often messy and complicated, and working through the push and pull of attraction and independence is rarely as simple as we're often led to believe.'(500) Days of Summer' may try to mislead you with its title and its opening lines. It may try to make you think it's not for romantics. But don't be fooled. By being honest, making me laugh unexpectedly, and especially for appreciating the differences that make us unique, it earned its way into my heart. It'll probably find its way into yours too.\",\n",
              "       \"It'll take something fiendishly brilliant to supplant PULP FICTION and KILL BILL as the top two in Tarantino's oeuvre, and INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS - an alternate-reality World War II fable - almost done it. Don't fall for that bit of misdirection in which the film is promoted as a Brad Pitt starrer. Brad Pitt isn't the lead as much as a key cog in a rather remarkable ensemble cast. Yes, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is partly about a gritty commando unit called the Basterds, comprised of Jewish-American soldiers and led by Pitt's Lt. Aldo Raine. On the surface, one questions whether the square-jawed American government would actually deploy such a mean and nasty terror team behind enemy lines to inflict brutal just desserts on them swastika-bearers, but we're all worldly folks here. Pitt plays his character as an unabashed caricature, and, in a weird way, he provides the brunt of the film's comedy. I say in a weird way because Lt. Aldo Raine happens to be a no-nonsense Southern-drawled gent who never backs down from his unsavory mission, nor does he shy away from inflicting torture on the Nazis. But he's got a way about him. There's an irrepressible glint in his eye when he remarks: We're in the Nazi killing business ... and let me tell you cousin, business is a-booming. Brad Pitt is having fun spreading inhumane terror.But it's not all about the Basterds and their ruination of the German soldiers' beauty sleep. The Basterds get more screen time than the Howling Commandos in CAPTAIN AMERICA, but it's not by much. Tarantino has always had this knack of picking out actors who end up being perfect for their roles. And sometimes it means going out and finding a French actress to play a French character or a German actor (or, in this case, Austrian) to play the Nazi big bad. Christoph Waltz could not better be as Colonel Hans Landa, the slimy but fiendishly clever Jew Hunter. Waltz turns in one of the year's most memorable performances, and it's even more impressive once you realize that he does this while speaking in three - almost four - languages. There's a sustained element of danger about him. Waltz imbues Landa with such serpentine intellect. The Colonel seems even more deadly when he's engaging in small talk with the other characters. You're rendered all nervous, wondering just what he's figured out and when he'll spring his trap on them unsuspecting targets.Most of the film takes place in Nazi-occupied France. The film is segmented into chapters, several of which feature the hard-bitten young Jewess Shoshanna Dreyfus who three years ago was Emanuelle Mimuex, a fugitive who witnessed the slaughter of her family. Nowadays Shoshanna is minding her business which happens to be running her own movie theater. But when her cinema becomes the site of a propaganda German film - an event to which the most highly ranked German officers are invited (even a certain failed artist) - Shoshanna sees a chance for get-back. I'd never seen French actress M&eacute;lanie Laurent in anything before, so I don't know if she's this routinely captivating. But her arc is the most heartbreaking. One of my favorite bits in the movie features Laurent in a showstopping sequence serenaded by David Bowie's Cat People (Putting out Fire). Others may say the inclusion of a Bowie song is jarring. I say it's friggin' brilliant.All the plot threads converge at Shoshanna's modest little theater, but not before Tarantino gets to play a little bit. He peppers his picture with compelling vignettes, treats us to colorful side characters. Michael Fassbender is very good as a British officer who goes undercover in France. Fassbender exhibits a cool steeliness which may have in part won him the part of Magneto in X-MEN: FIRST CLASS. Diane Kruger gets maybe her meatiest role as German actress and double agent Bridget von Hammersmark. Til Schweiger and Eli Roth make their mark as, respectively, the Basterds' sadistic German recruit, Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz, and the baseball bat wielding Sgt. Donny Donowitz a.k.a. the Bear Jew. For trivia buffs, Eli Roth directed HOSTEL and also the film within this film, NATION`S PRIDE, the German film which has its special screening at Shoshanna's theater. You can see this short film in its entirety in the DVD's bonus features.Tarantino's trademark cinematic flourishes are still present, although they may be a trifle subdued. His flair for dialogue isn't as in your face, mostly because sub-titles grace huge chunks of the film. But there's still a sense of suspense and the unexpected in the conversations. Anytime that Christoph Waltz chats up a potential suspect, or that tension-fraught sequence in the bar downstairs, the dialogue plays out like a high stakes chess match. I will say that I think this is the most disciplined that I've seen Tarantino in a while. Or maybe DEATH PROOF and its talky excesses lingers that strongly in the brain. That's not to say that INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS isn't talky, because it is. But Tarantino stays on point with the words. The script stays relevant to the plot. And while the action isn't at all as constant as that in KILL BILL, the violence when it arrives is chilling stuff. Lt. Aldo Raine's mandate is one hundred Nazi scalps from each of his men. They gleefully set about filling their quota. And if you're looking for a virtuous protagonist to pin your allegiance to, well, keep looking, brother. Tarantino delivers a strange, pulpy, morally-askewed war drama. INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS may come off like an arthouse film, but it's not for sissies.\",\n",

Together, they become the finest chef in France but problems arise in the restaurant and with Remy's family that can jeopardize the whole scheme. I have to say that the best character is Linguini, it's obvious that the animators had a blast animating him because it's so funny and all his mannerisms are executed spectacularly. Themes like family, friendship, passion and more are the core of the film and everything is enveloped in a beautiful score by the great Michael Giacchino. The animation is a sight to behold. Paris looks so beautifully breathtaking and the food looks so deliciously real that you will get real hungry while watching the film. Ratatouille is Pixar's 8th triumph and one they should be very proud about. A wonderful film.Video & Audio:Ratatouille comes to BD looking absolutely fantastic. This is hardly a surprise being a Pixar film but still the transfer mesmerize. Colors jump off the screen, detail and contrast are terrific and no compression artifacts whatsoever.

              "       \"Ben Affleck, not only can you act, you have some serious directorial chops.  Case in point:  THE TOWN, a taunt, tight, violent whirlwind of a movie centering around a gang of robbers in the Charlestown projects of Boston.  Affleck plays Doug MacRay, the leader of the gang; MacRay is a most reluctant robber, tormented and troubled by his violent existence, and when he falls in love with the bank manager of one of his heists (Rebecca Hall, who is stellar in her own right), he realizes it's time to leave his turbulent neighborhood behind--except circumstances won't allow, culminating in a Fenway Park heist that goes tragically awry.Not only is the cast exceptional, but Affleck moves the viewer through the story, the dialogue, the character interactions, and the streets of Beantown with a rugged authenticity that is staggering.  This film gets up and moves, and the action is as intense as it is mesmerizing.  Kudos to the rest of the cast, including Jon Hamm as a tightly wound FBI agent, Chris Cooper in a brief appearance as MacRay's prison-dwelling father, and Pete Postlethwaite as a gum-chewing, almost creepy, mob boss.  Yet Jeremy Renner stands out handsomely as Jem, MacRay's violent, hot-tempered best friend.  Renner is an up-and-coming superstar, and with the look and feel of THE TOWN, Affleck is one impressive director.--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning\",\n",
              "       \"Despite the diligent efforts of Chris Farley (1964-1997), who delivers most of the movie's funniest moments, Black Sheep lacks the substance and cohesiveness to be a solid comedy.  With issues that are mostly story and character related, the various pieces just don't seem to fit together very well.  The script was apparently rushed, and there were some major issues between director Penelope Spheeris (Wayne's World films) and David Spade.Mike Donnelly (Farley), who works at a recreation center, is the younger brother of Al Donnelly (Tim Matheson), who is running for governor of the great state of Washington, taking on the incumbent Governor Tracy (Christine Ebersole).  Mike is well intentioned, but his screw ups are proving to be an embarrassment to the campaign, so brother Al approves of a plan to put Mike to work where he can't do any damage.  Steve Dodds (David Spade), a member of Donnelly's staff is assigned to keep Mike out of trouble, as the pair are sent to a cabin deep in Wenatchee National Forest.  There they meet Drake Sabitch (Gary Busey), a right wing type who lives in a trailer in the woods.  When the election results come in, Governor Tracy appears to have squeezed out a narrow victory, but when Mike finds evidence of voter fraud, he and Dodds race to the capitol to expose the crime.Chris Farley tries to make the most of a script that is a hodgepodge of ideas, and lacks a tight storyline.  Slapstick physical comedy is Farley's forte, and he displays these talents many times.  Unfortunately David Spade, Farley's co-star in Tommy Boy (1995), has much less to do, and isn't particularly funny, as Steve Dodds is mostly a twerp who gets squashed down by everyone, and even wets himself.  Tim Matheson is a decent actor, but he and Farley just do not match up well as brothers.  Grant Heslov as Mike's police officer buddy, provides minor comic support.  There's not much plot development regarding Governor Tracy's dirty deeds, or a teenage kid that Mike befriends.  In the end, while Chris Farley provides some funny moments, the story just seems slapped together, rattling along with a lot of loose ends.WhileBeverly Hills Ninja(1997) is a much stronger effort, as one of his four feature films, Black Sheep is probably a must see for fans of the late Chris Farley.  Almost everyone else, may want to pass on this one, which comes in at 2.5 stars.  The big man is honestly the best thing about this movie, with some slight support from Gary Busey and David Spade.\",\n",

This man can act! Can express melancholy, dismay and a sense of what's next? fun, with great humour.I saw a long show with Clay back in '89 at a huge auditorium in the Catskills, New York, and it was very good. This led to buying his VHS of the Madison Square Garden concert. I didn't expect a showcase for *acting* talent to the degree that I forgot about his act - and not your run-of-the-mill feminist-era schlemeil man - this dude takes us back to the streets in 1962, leather, pompador, smokes!At times the sharp but good-natured satire here is lost, however: there are some brilliant swipes at Madonna's first film (title escapes me), the Heavy Metal business, more accurately the turn of the decade music industry, when it appeared that self-implosion was imminent. Billions of bucks made...and the artists...screwed! Not nearly as bad as with the rock and roll originators (by the way, enjoy the great cover of Sea Cruise by Dion on the soundtrack), but still bad.Another guy getting screwed is failed Eastern Rocker cum semi-successful Western Rock and Roll Detective Ford Fairlane, who does not drive a '90 muscle car but an antique (you guessed it) Ford Fairlane, immaculately cared for. It's a retret of sorts...as is his authentic, 1962 Jimi Hendrix electric guitar.Now, to the sometimes elusive plot, involving tracking down a homeless kid's Dad *and* tracking down a groupie for no apparent reason...well, it never stalls, never gets sentimental (but wait for the end, not gonna give it away); the action is fast and furious, and the backdrops are always cool. Dice finds himself on the roof of Capitol Records...no symbolism, just Clay in another wild situation.Great, exhilirating fun watching real rockers of the time, like Vince Neil, watching Mister Vegas, Wayne Newton do a very credible job - if this guy doesn't bring realism to a movie about the music business, no one does. We even encounter Mrs. Presley - Priscilla in a light spoof of the film noir widow, mysteriously arriving at Fairlane's desk with a wad of cash.There should have been at least three sequels..but not to be. Making a solid suspense story permeated with hip humour was not going to do it. The, shall we say, Militant Feminist Lobby, at the time, apparently did want to consider the subtleties of Clay, the value of exploding stereotype; in all fairness, even in this good movie, there are a few things too close to his adults only club act and so it was good-bye to a major movie career and hello to Cultist artifact...and modest success back on the club circuit.\",\n",

As world-class bounty hunters chasing the same contract, the two agree to an uneasy truce before turning every trick in the book to double-cross and one-up each other. It's an unrelenting barrage of stern-faced masculinity, bravado and marksmanship, with filthy hired hands perfectly willing to trade bullets around every other corner. As with each of the director's dust-soaked pictures, this film covers for its small budget with an excess of personality and buckets of atmosphere, which results in a tougher, bolder, more genuine take than the most expensive Hollywood blockbusters of today. The infamous showdown with a truly despicable set of bounties may be what sends this picture riding off into the sunset, but it's a quieter scene earlier in the story that's always stuck with me: two grizzled old hunters trying to impress one other with nothing more than an empty street, a set of pistols and a pair of bullet-riddled hats.\",\n",

The only problem is that The Dude finds himself involved in the exchange of the money for Mrs. Lebowski--except the money is stolen. Add in John Goodman as a slightly deranged gun toting convert to Judeaism who wants to keep the ransom money and Jesus (John Turturro)a fancy dressing bowler who likes to lick his ball before bowling for a soup of wacky characters. A terrific supporting cast includes Julianna Moore, Steve Buscemi among others only enhances this black comedy with their mixture of eccentric and deadpan performances.I've read a couple of reviews of The Big Lebowski indicating that this is a nearly flawless transfer. I'd disagree. It looks decent but suffers from too much DNR smoothing over the skin textures to an unnatural degree--they don't look like wax figures but the film could look a bit better. There's also evidence of edge enhancement in several early scenes where The Dude meets Mr. Lobowski. This isn't much of an improvement over the DVD and evidently was pulled from the same source as the HD-DVD transfer from a couple of years back.It's a very poor effort from Universal in terms of the transfer itself. If you're not picky about your Blu-ray image quality, you'll think this looks just fine for those who are you will be somewhat disappointed. There's good and bad about the transfer.The 5.1 lossless mix sounds exceptionally good--it's a pity the film isn't presented with as much care.The extras are really good--we get a really good making of featurette as well as a paen to The Dude housed in a hardcover Blu-ray holder with a booklet filled with photos. The U Control feature here allows trivia to pop up now and again and a counter that keeps track of all the profanity in the film (and there's a lot).We also get Jeff Bridges' photo album, Flying Carpets and Bowling Pins a featurette on the dream sequence for the film and an interactive map.While the extras are very good, the transfer of the film itself is disappointing.Five stars for the movie, 2 stars for the transfer--shame on you Universal!\",\n",

He works the character interplay and the entire mood of the film to delicious effect.Based on an Elmore Leonard novel, Out of Sight, together with Get Shorty, mines the novelist's particular brand of witty repartee, literal character assassination, sudden outbursts of violence and multiple plotlines as a source of cinematic richness. Extremely self confident yet lethally stupid characters, perfectly played here by Don Cheadle, Isiah Washington and Pablo Guzman, are mixed in with the merely clueless, played by Steve Zahn and (in an uncharacteristic role) Catherine Keener and the judgementally impaired characters of Albert Brooks and Ving Rhames. Clooney, Lopez and Dennis Farina, as Lopez's loving but deeply skeptical father, are present to suggest that not only fools, but extremely shrewd cookies inhabit Leonard's distinctive universe.Steven Soderbergh, as the expert director, doing some of the finest work of his career, and Anne V. Coates(Lawrence of Arabia)as the sharply honing editor, keep the challenging chronology and overlapping, revisited scenes aloft with the extreme dexterity of accomplished jugglers. The complex lighting schemes, ranging from those of sunny Florida to snowy Michigan, are beautifully etched on the Blu-ray version, with flawless skin tones and vibrant sense of place.

That being said, though, before his accident, Aron came off as a kind-hearted, likeable guy, but also a bit of an airhead.Still, what he went through was hideous, and while Boyle managed to convey a lot of that, I also totally grasp that while the flashbacks were the only way to develop Aron's character, a number were either too long, too confusing, or simply not necessary. It's also true certain facts from the book would've really helped the film. The last was there were several scenes, particularly some of the wandering or long, panning shots that went on too long. Again, I understand Boyle was trying to convey the vastness of the canyon and the area, but we all got it after the first or second camera sweep. No need to keep revisiting it.

In the end, it feels that Affleck and company felt more compelled to capture the mood and feel of their beloved Boston locale, rather then see the riveting story through to what should have been a better conclusion.The film follows a band of thieves who hold up banks and armored trucks with expert precision.  Following the film's first robbery, Affleck's Doug strikes up a quick relationship with one of the hostages (Rebecca Hall as Claire) in an attempt to ensure she doesn't know enough to tip off the feds.  This he does in an effort to prevent his comrade Jem (Jeremy Renner) from simply killing her for safety's sake.  The first half of the film allows the tension to build, as we the audience know that Claire can ID a tell-tale tattoo on Jem's neck if she ever sees it, and that Jem will surely kill her the moment he believes her to be a liability.The problem I have with the film is that the third act takes the film in an altogether different direction, echoing the similar denouement of HEAT, whereby the thugs chase one last big score, regardless of the feds already nipping at their heels.  This, and the inclusion of another threat from the local drug kingpin that only comes to bear in the final act makes it feel like the script went through re-writes before being committed to film (although it is an adaptation of a novel, so the source material may have followed the same path, I don't know).Affleck, Renner, and Hall play their roles well, as does Blake Lively as the doped-out sometimes girlfriend and Joe Hamm as the G-man hot on the heels of the thugs.  Affleck's direction is certainly competent, suggesting a possible future with more success behind the camera than in front.  If only the story had stayed on task rather than devolving to the predictable anti-climax, this may have been a much better film.  I never felt the sympathy for the characters that the ending demands.  Many of the decisions by the characters in the final parts of the film felt less honest and more like actions taken to serve the convenience of ending the film arbitrarily.As it is, the film garnered much critical praise - but one can't help but wonder if this wasn't due more to the surprise to be had in seeing that a veteran actor can also pull off a directorial feat such as this.  Were it a no-name director, the film might have been largely overlooked.It's certainly not a bad film by any stretch, but some tinkering with the script would have made a better final product.  To see a much better heist film with similar beats, (though lacking the Bah-ston setting) check out Michael Mann's far superior HEAT.\",\n",
              "       \"Ben Affleck will be forever identified with two powerful influences on his life:  his friendship with fellow Hollywood demigod Matt Damon and his devotion to the city of Boston.  (You could also add the perils of over-exploiting the Hollywood celebrity machine with J-Lo as another influence, but that would be cruel.)With The Town, Affleck follows in the footsteps of his friend Damon - is it a coincidence that Hollywood green-lit an Affleck-led Boston crime movie shortly after Damon's performance in The Departed? - by making a terrific cops-and-robbers movie set in Boston.  With The Town, Affleck famously does the heavy lifting of directing, adapting the screenplay from a novel (Prince of Thieves), and starring.  I haven't read the book, but it's safe to say that he did a fine job with at least two of his three roles.The Town tells the story of a next-generation gang of Boston criminals, led by Doug McCray (Affleck).  His best friend, Jem (James Coughlin), has done nine years hard time after committing a crime to help Doug - think of Jem as a younger Boston-based version of Joe Pesci's various characters.  These guys rob banks and armored cars, and they are good - so good that the FBI is gunning for them.  FBI Agent Frawley (Jon Hamm) is on the case, and he's good at his job, too, so fireworks are guaranteed.The main storyline involves a girl:  the gang hits a bank and in the process may have allowed the assistant bank manager Claire (Rebecca Hall) to see something incriminating . . . and it turns out she lives in their neighborhood in South Boston.  Jem wants to deal with her so that she's guaranteed never to testify, but Doug tries his own tactics.  Doug quickly falls for Claire and is caught in the web of his own deceit.The Town is aptly named, as all the characters are caught up by the lives they have already lived in South Boston, where everybody seems to be either a criminal or in love with one.  The town forces you to make choices, and those choices have lingering consequences.Beautifully shot, The Town offers a visual tour of Boston and culminates in a daring shoot-out at Fenway Park.  This is an intelligent piece of filmmaking - we're not talking about Point Break:  Boston here - and the full cast does the story proud.\",\n",

              "       \"Just as effective as the 1972 original, yet for vastly different reasons, Steven Soderbergh's triumphant sci-fi masterpiece is an intellectually stimulating look at loneliness, love and eventual madness.  The film is stunning to look at, with each set piece moving in such stimulating manners; and the film itself has such a ferocious fluidity that completely takes you over.  It is hypnotic in a way, shifting rather effortlessly from present day moments to flashback sequences.  The film, in a more modern sense, is far more visually captivating than the original film (both films are adapted from the novel written by Stanislaw Lem, so it would be inaccurate to say that this 2002 film is a remake of Tarkovsky's '72 masterpiece).  Both films, while constructively different, are marvelous cinematic feats.  I think that, overall, Tarkovsky's film makes the strongest statement (and it remains haunting regardless of how many times I watch it), but that is no discredit to the work that Soderbergh does with this underrated classic.Why isn't this loved deeply by all?Chris Kelvin is a psychologist sent to a space station orbiting an alien planet.  That particular station has stopped all communications, and Kelvin is sent to investigate why.  When Kelvin arrives he is quickly absorbed into the manipulated atmosphere created by the glowing orb lingering outside the space station.  Infiltrating his inner desires, this planet projects Kelvin's deceased wife.  Kelvin's rationality initially rejects this reincarnation but with persistence this planet is able to get inside his head, where he wholly accepts this woman as the root of all happiness.Soderbergh's interpretation of the source material is vastly different than Tarkovsky's.  Apparently, neither director appeased the novel's author, who was vocally opposed to both film adaptations.  Where Tarkovsky projected a coldness that seemed to highlight the story's more intellectual side, Soderbergh plays to the romantic, creating a more warm and embracive texture with the film.  The film is a visual marvel, and Soderbergh uses that element with such finesse.The performances here are all top notch.  Clooney really sinks into the role, and while his character can at moments feel more observational than anything else (like a mere canvas for those around him to paint), he grounds his performance in a `felt' emotional resistance.  Viola Davis is extraordinary here, finding a solemn depth of character that lives in the small moments.  Jeremy Davies provides small splashes of humor that break up the film's consistent tension, and Natascha McElhone uses more than just her stunning looks to captivate the audience (and Clooney).I can understand why some are put off by this film; for it is not the most accessible feature film.  Honestly though, this is a stunning piece of work, and it serves as a complimentary piece to Tarkovsky's version because they tell two sides of the same story, or two variations, so that we can get a fuller picture, which in the end may be exactly what Stanislaw Lem would have wished us to see.\",\n",
              "       \"There is little to say about a film whose genius needs little analysis. Welles' mock[ing]-biography of William Randolph Hearst is an attack on just about everything wrong with this country. Nothing has changed in 70 years, and Kane remains an indictment of our vulgar, grossly materialistic society. It is also an extremely entertaining -- and yes, fun -- film that holds your interest from beginning to end. The last 30 seconds -- among the most-famous in film history -- ought to make any halfway rational person seriously question what they're doing with their lives. (The Kane theme is a variation on the Dies Irae.)Is it really the best movie ever made? I can only answer that with another question -- what film would replace it for #1? When People magazine selected the 100 greatest films more than a decade ago, Kane was #2, behind The Godfather. As great as Coppola's masterpiece is, it lacks the startle factor of Kane. Even by modern standards, Kane's screenplay, cinematography, and non-linear (but easily grasped) structure remain remarkable. Reviewers said they'd never seen anything like it, and in an age of boring, overwrought CGI extravaganzas, Kane remains unique. No one has quite caught up with it. *'til now, the best transfer was the DVD of a few years back (apparently from the composite negative), a big improvement over the previous transfers from prints. This is probably from the same source, but scanned at 4K. Whether you should replace that copy depends on how big your set is, how close you sit, and the quality of the scaler in your BD player. All I can say is that I've never enjoyed the film so much.The only thing that would get me to buy yet another edition (I still have the Criterion LV) is a restoration of the soundtrack. If the dialog and effects stems still exist (and they probably do), it would be nothing more than a matter of finding the money to re-record Bernard Herrmann's score in modern surround sound. With a bit of amplitude and phase EQ to the dialog, Citizen Kane would emerge even better than the original.* Since writing this, I've thought of two films that can truly stand comparison with Citizen Kane -- Chinatown and L. A. Confidential. Both are among the finest films I've seen, and reward repeated viewing.\",\n",
              "       \"Made 40 years after the end of The Great Patriotic War, Kilmov's 'Come and See' is often hailed as a masterpiece of realism and fact, regarding German actions in Russia during the war. Unfortunately, real factual atrocity notwithstanding, I found very little in 'Come and See' to be factual at all, because the director chose to shoot the film in a shroud of arty murkiness, rather than as a clear historical document of atrocity and for the vast majority of the film, there is very little going on.Essentially, viewed through the eyes of the young protagonist, Florya, the viewer is presented a singular Russian view of WWII. It's simplistic, with little grey area and it absolutely subtracts any homegrown Russian atrocity in favor of the bog standard foreign invader type. There are no complexities available in 'Come and See', there are no questions on the nature of war, or atrocity and there are no honest appraisals of the conduct of the people involved in the conflict. It's simply a short film about an atrocity, wrapped up in a much longer film about nothing.In the first three quarters of the film, Florya and his young naive female friend, Glasha, go on an insipid odyssey, leading him to seek out a partisan band and join up. The kids dance in the rain, babble on inanely about nothing, go deaf from explosions and look up at a FW189 recon plane that drones around the sky above their heads. Eventually, after a terribly tedious amount of time detailing very little, we get to the point of the film, the German's burning down a village barn and killing the inhabitants.These scenes at the end of the film are quite hard to watch and are handled well, for what they are. But, it takes so long for the film to get to the point that the danger is that the viewer might not care any more. I really cannot emphasize enough how little actually happens for the bulk of the running time. It's a film that demands that the viewer be extremely patient with it.But, there are also issues to be dealt with regarding 'Come and See's central scene. The nazi's are presented as some sort of wasteland warrior types, straight out of a 'Mad Max' film, or something. They absolutely do not represent any historical counterpart, though the film attempts to suggest that they are the 15th Einsatzkommando. They are the Russian view of the Germans and in that bracket alone, the viewer must be careful of what he's being told. The Germans are cardboard villains, not people. They are sadistic, vile, rapacious, murderous and cowardly. The lead up to burning the barn is also filled with ridiculous shots of surreal nonsense, with people doing extraordinary things for no reason. The Germans herd the Russian villagers to their doom, while playing music over a loudspeaker and saying things like Germany is a civilised country. They laugh and goof around, drink alcohol, make stupid faces at the camera and get ready to enjoy some good old slaughter.On the other hand the Communist partisans are playful, comradely and righteous in the way only movies can portray. They are completely contrasted to the German savages, with neither portrayal of the opposing sides containing any real truth or fact and the view of the Germans is bordering on racism.It's clear what this Soviet commissioned film is trying to do.As a surrealist horror fantasy, 'Come and See' has some merit, if only for the 20 minute barn burning sequence. The rest of the film though, is a real chore and very tough going. It's filled with absurd imagery too, like the female nazi eating shellfish while she enjoys the view of the burning barn. She looks like she's come straight from a nazi fetish website. One also never gets the sense that the director is inviting the viewer to do anything but get bludgeoned over the head by his visuals and overwrought tone.In the end, I'm left with mixed feelings about 'Come and See'. The mechanics of the film are dreadful at times and it certainly is in need of a much better script. The acting is decent throughout and the last quarter of the film, though heavyhanded,  is rewarding...if one can call such visuals rewarding. However, while it's important to remember man's inhumanity to man, when it's constantly portrayed as coming from certain quarters only, one can get a little jaded. Films with purpose, like 'Come and See', can also leave a bad taste in the mouth. While its comments on Hitler and Nazism as a vile entity are entirely correct, it quite conveniently leaves out any comments on Communisms own atrocious excesses.\",\n",

Michael is no prima donna by any means, and he appears like someone you could easily talk to as a friend if you are friends with him. His talent is second nature to him like breathing and eating, all he has to do is to present it in perfected mode for a dynamite act that will wow em in the audience.The advantage here, although I wish he could have completed his tour as scheduled, is we as an audience not only get to see the rehearsals for his dynamite swan song concert, but the vibrations and chemistry of the inside look towards his backups, dancers, and studio technicians which might have been completely overlooked in the main event. What is the validity to this? Michael himself that this quote unquote This Is It mission is the final hour for his days of touring shows. On the brief other hand, we have aspiring new talent who have emulated Michael all their lives, and now have a chance to glow beside him. This is their hour as well, to glow on stage next to the master. It is this factor that makes this video a class all its own outside of another dress rehearsal of a major pop star. If you could eclipse the events that led to his accidental death just for a moment, we see the mega talent of yesterday colliding with the new world of today. Michael himself said his songs were possibly outdated since they are almost entirely devoid of any kind of rap labels of today. This should not concern him, however, since even the most rap star bros cannot do anything but see Michael as the ongoing mega star he is, and you can tell quite plainly by their reverence in talking to him while rehearsing through the numbers one at a time.Excellent documentary video, and probably a better concert with vast chemistry other than a dynamic performance by all, and the technicians left in the dark.\",\n",
              "       \"When does homage drift into the territory of derivative knock-off? When the director doesn't insert any of himself into his tribute to the other film. Clearly inspired by Hitchcock and his films (particularlyPsycho (50th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray] andFrenzywhich, ironically, was, in turn, influenced by Brian DePalma's thrillers along with other directors). DePalma's film is equal parts thriller and adroit self reflective humor playing with the audience's expectations and the knowledge that it is a film.Dressed to Kill continues to demonstrate DePalma's often perverse sense of humor that he first put on display withSisters (The Criterion Collection).When a transsexual patient of Doctor Robert Elliot (Michael Caine) goes on a serial killing spree, a hooker Liz Blake(Nancy Allen)finds herself both one of the prime suspects AND the potential victim. She works with the son (Keith Gordon) of a victim in trying to find the real killer and not be murdered in the process.The MGM Blu-ray transfer is an improvement over the original DVD and while I wouldn't call it perfect, it's quite a bit better than some folks have complained; viewers need to keep in mind that this was made in 1980 when there was a major shift in the type of film stocks (and shooting styles)being used and Dressed to Kill although looking quite nice on Blu-ray is VERY much reflecting of the decade it was shot in.Although it isn't quite as good as the recent transfer of DePalma's Blow Up done by Criterion (a later film which shares many of the characteristics in terms of the look of the film), the images for DtK are sharper, there's better depth although certain shots have an inherent softness that was intentional from the beginning by the cinematographer Ralf Bode (Coalminer's Daughter)and director DePalma.The audio sounds quite good but, again, keep in mind when it was made--1980--prior to the introduction of Surround Sound and when many films were still being exhibited in mono. The 5.1 mix sounds pretty good for it's time improving on the previous DVD version although the film could probably due with a proper restoration with a contemporary mix to 5.1, it's unlikely to happen. Pino Donaggio's score sounds quite nice in its presentation here.Although this is a recent release you wouldn't know it from the way the menu is designed; it features a poorly designed interface and when you pop the film in it just starts. The special features which were ported over from the 2001 DVD (and, I suspect, this might be an older high def transfer of the film as well)are quite good giving some insight into DePalma's intent and what atttracted the actors to the material. It's a pity that Michael Caine wasn't interviewed for this reissue.We get an interesting film comparison between the theatrical/unrated/tv versions of the film which is quite interesting particularly if you weren't aware of the censorship that occurred at the time as film directors were increasingly pushing the barrier of what was acceptable.The 45 minute making-of film provides us with interviews of Dickenson, DePalma, Gordon and Allen discussing the making of the film, it's reception and their take on it today. It's got some amusing stories about the making of the film as well.The appreciation by actor/director Keith Gordon is particularly interesting; Gordon's perspective as a film director himself allows for a meaningful take on why the film still works so well. We also get the original theatrical trailer as well as a photo gallery and a featurette on what was edited out of the film to maintain an R rating at the time.Although few would argue that Dressed to Kill broke any ground as a thriller, DePalma's film pushes the boundaries of what the audience wanted to see in a thriller in some unique, sometimes humorous ways creating a film that this is as much about the process of the audience watching a film as it is about the story we see on screen.Recommended.\",\n",
              "       \"Two conflicting movies fight for dominance in the interesting if seriously flawed Hollywoodland. One of them stars Ben Affleck as Geroge Reeves, a struggling actor who catches his one lucky break by becoming the star of the early TV Series, Superman. Reeves is charming, funny, clever and witty, but not much of an actor. He has an angel in the form of Toni Mannix (an excellent Diane Lane), who picks Reeves to be her personal boytoy, sets him up with a home, jobs, all that her rich husband, MGM Studio VP Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins, channelling his inner Ed Asner). Eddie has his own toys, but he has a dark lining. Then there's the gold-digging Leona, who Reeves has an affair with, much to the consternation of Toni. But then, maybe Toni talked George out of marrying Leona. Or maybe George was just sick of Leona and called off a wedding to be with Toni. We never know, because a depressed Reeves committed suicide in 1959.Or did he? This is the issue that Hollywoodland grapples with. Any one of these people orbiting Reeves had ample motive to kill him, and his death was clouded in controversy at the time. In this half of the movie, director Allen Coulter (his first movie after critically acclaimed TV episodes of The Sopranos and Rome for HBO) creates an interesting scenario of Old Hollywood, power, and dirty relationships. Not only that, he recreates the 50's in spectacular style, with a particular heads up for all the classic cars you'll see. Affleck is also at his best as the doomed actor, playong all the sides of Reeves in what was an Oscar worthy job.However, there's a second part to this, and that is the Film Noir attached to it. This part stars Adrian Brody, doing a great job as hack detective Louis Simo. Simo gets hired when Reeves' mother raises suspicions that her son would not have killed himself. So Simo goes digging where others are too scared to, and Simo can't afford not to. Brody is engaging as Simo, although I kept thinking of Micheal Imperioli doing Chrissy on The Sopranos, to the point where I began thinking Brody was forced to watch the series to get the part down. And since Simo's story is trying to uncover the truth behind Reeves', it seems that we are forced to watch as the two stories, told as separate timelines (and in Reeves' case, as flashbacks) play out.That's where the schism takes place. Simo's life is coming undone, and Hollywoodland keeps trying to force-fit Reeves' career slide with Simo's domestic problems. Reeves' life is so interesting that the continual forced jamming of Simo's becomes unsettling; the film works best when Simo is trying to pry up the boards of the all too pristine Hollywood system. There are so many subplots and spinouts from that main course, the movie ultimately falters. It's way better than The Black Dahlia or Zodiac, but it's nowhere near the likes of LA Confidential. Or even a couple episodes of The Sopranos, for that matter.\",\n",

Night Shyamalan seems to have hit his stride in his first film, The Sixth Sense, and despite the fact that he elects to continue exploring the dark side of thought, his recent products have a lot of promise but seem to falter in the endings.  DEVIL is like that.  One wants to suggest that this is his take on Sartre's 'No Exit' but after the film gets rolling it simply falls into the category of another stuck elevator story where the people inhabiting the chamber reveal all the good and bad aspects of human behavior while providing a platform for a little 'the devil made me do it'  chatter.The film starts well enough with gorgeous upside down vistas of the city of Philadelphia. A body lies on the street in front of a glass skyscraper and the police are called - Detective Bowden (Chris Messina) has reported to figure out what is happening - a suicide or murderous fall.  Attention turns inside where five people enter an elevator: a Mechanic (Logan Marshall-Green), a mattress salesman (Geoffrey Arend), a security guard (Bokeem Woodbine), a fussy older lady (Jenny O'Hara), and a young woman (Bojana Novakovic). The elevator abruptly stops between floors and the claustrophobia of the situation begins to wear on the nerves of the five people.  They are watched on video camera and a one way speaker  by two other security guards - Lustig (Matt Craven) and Ramirez (Jacob Vargas).  Strange things begin to happen and one by one the people trapped in the elevator are murdered. Ramirez swears this is the work of the Devil and gradually his fears seem to be true.  The actual identity of the Devil comes as a surprise as does the ending of the film - the lone survivor being connected by history to Detective Bowden's tragedy in the past.The story does well in the category of suspense, and it is populated by a very able cast of actors, but it is the superimposition of moralizing and the need to make the Devil a person that pulls the plug on the intensity of the story.  It has it's moments but in the end it leans a bit toward the silly side.  Grady Harp, September 11\",\n",
              "       \"Though it feels preachy at times and the avalanche of Anti-semitic incidents, one following rapidly on the heels of another, feels too coincidental (the viewer is tempted to wonder what bad thing will happen next, as in a horror film), this film feels, paradoxically, more open and honest in exposing the hypocrisy of so-called liberal people than today's films and unflinchingly explores all the subtleties of prejudice. I haven't seen a film about blacks, Asians or Muslims that digs so deep into the perception of a group beyond the hackneyed bigot spouting stereotypical ethnic slurs. No, racism goes deeper, is more insidious, and I liked how all varieties of racism are expressed, from backhanded compliments (Aren't you in PR? You people are clever - from a guy assuming Peck must be in that field because he's Jewish) - to implications that Jews are crafty and dishonest (that doctor strings people along and overcharges, you know what I mean) to Jewish anti-semites - self-hating Jews would harbor their own bigotry - to silent racism - the over-polite manner of the bigoted hotel owner who unapologetically turns Peck away without a ruffle of his suit. While it focuses on Anti-semitism, any member of a minority or oppressed group can easily identify with the protagonist.To understand why this film was made, I tend to see it as a reaction to America's war whoop of superiority following WWII in which Hitler's death camps were unveiled to a horrified world. After being confronted with that shock of genocide, many in the U.S. probably tried to reassure themselves it couldn't happen here. That it COULD have happened here (and it did, in a milder form with Japanese-Americans being interned in concentration camps) is brought home by this film, which served as a reminder that the U.S. and German attitudes toward the Jews weren't different. This film humbles us and reminds us that racism and prejudice spare no country, and that, before we think so mighty of ourselves and our ideals of equality, we should take a hard look at ourselves and acknowledge our shortcomings.\",\n",

For every joke that lands, Myers ricochets three or four duds off his companions' foreheads, lending the impression that he's always on stage and robbing his turn as well-intentioned poet Charlie of a meaningful connection with the audience. Clunky, distracting post-production work and an excessive dose of early '90s pop culture also prove to be tricky obstacles, dating the material and lending the impression that it wasn't quite polished enough for a final release. When it's working, few films from the era are so consistently funny, but those sporadic dots of brilliance aren't quite enough to compensate for the shaky, timid nature of the rest of the story.

All of the original's deeper underlying meanings are still there, buried in the actions and expressions of the transfigured creatures Smith does his best to avoid, but without a big reveal to lay all the cards on the table they're too easily shrugged off or overlooked altogether. That positions this as, basically, a hybrid summer blockbuster / suspense-laden monster movie with a better than usual premise. In this role it fares well - Smith portrays the terrifying isolation of the last sane man on Earth with passion and depth, leaving memories of his less-inspired earlier work far in the past. He's come a long way from Independence Day or even Hancock, and surprisingly little of that has the more stern-faced, serious script to thank.

Almost everything about it is predisposed to controversy, which is arguably what makes it such a brilliant examination of the violence within.David Sumner has come to England to live in his wife Amy's hometown.  Immediately he recognizes his outsider status; the locals don't take kindly to him, and David for his part thinks himself superior.  This leads to tensions building between the Sumners and the townspeople, enhanced by the fact that one of the agitators was once Amy's lover.The fires in the film burn slowly, but when they reach their peak, they are massive.  It's an eruption of violence, much of it almost unwatchable, yet Peckinpah injects enough humanity--easily mistaken for sexism and egoism, perhaps--into all of it that you can't help but look away.  As David and Amy, Dustin Hoffman and Susan George have dynamic, realistic chemistry--their love is palpable, and so are their fights, and the slow disintegration of their marriage makes complete sense given the context.  The violence that ultimately ensues is not over-the-top, really; it's just awful to watch because it hits close to home.  What Peckinpah is suggesting is that every one of us is capable of discovering something new, and that we may not always like what we find.The Blu-ray (which I'm reviewing) is a mixed blessing.  It's nice to have the film available again (remakes are good for something, I guess), and it looks/sounds fantastic (sound, indeed, is a big deal here, especially in the brilliant climactic scene).  However, there are no bonus features aside from TV Spots and Theatrical Trailer (which sounded so mundane I didn't even check them out).  A making-of, tribute piece, or even a bit on Peckinpah himself (as we got with THE WILD BUNCH, a brilliant documentary narrated by Kris Kristofferson) would have been a nice addition.  As is, we get to judge the film on its own merits (as it should be), but the package is a little too bare-bones for the price tag.Make no mistake: STRAW DOGS is not for everyone.  Many will be bored; many will be appalled.  But if you are unafraid of films that examine the human condition, that take their time to make a frightening point, then this film is a must see.  If nothing else, it proves that Chekhov's old adage about a gun in the first act also applies to bear traps.  Yikes.\",\n",
              "       'This heist flick is better than most, but I wish Ben Affleck had avoided the usual car chase and shoot-em-ups that mar this otherwise tight picture. As a Massachusetts native, I am glad to report that everyone here gets the horrible accent just right, at least. When Affleck explores the human relationships, such as with his imprisoned father, his hoodlum buddy who served 9 years for him, his florist crime boss and his new and old girlfriends, he is better than when he is engaging in the usual Hollywood action cliches. The car chase through Charlestown in Boston is fun but completely unrealistic, as is the big shoot-em-up finale at Fenway Park. None of this could have happened. Thousands of rounds of AK-47 bullets flying. Right! Still, you can watch this for 2 hours and not be bored or ashamed.',\n",
              "       \"In the new chapter of Studio Ghibli it was time for Haiyo to let his son Goro Miyazaki try his hand at a new animated film. This time around we get `Tales From Earthsea' based on the famous fantasy novels. I was very much anticipating the chance to finally see this film, because while it came out in 2006 due to conflicts in America with their cable channel SyFi miniseries we had to wait a solid 4 years for Disney to finally have the rights and release the original animated film.Much like the mess that this film endured to get to the United States the film is no different. I feel that this movie was a B version of `The Princess Mononoke'. The story and the characters had so much potential seeing the scale and the depth of the story that revolves around corruption and inner evil inside good people. However, the plot is underdeveloped there are parts of the movie that make very little sense that you get lost in the film and even worse a great voice cast that  really doesn't get the chance to do great things like the casts in Studio Ghiblis past. I am happy that they didn't change the voice cast that was used because this animated film did premiere in 2006 and The United Kingdom did give the film its own dubbed version featuring Timothy Dalton and Willam Dafoe.Unfortunately, this film didn't grab me as I would have hoped, in fact I almost fell asleep watching it. I am also a little unhappy, because it seems that Studio Ghibli is not really going with original stories anymore. If you take a look at where Ghibli began and where they are now their films are starting to become a hit or miss. I am looking forward to the next film this coming February, I just hope it is good.\",\n",

Anthony Hopkins doesn't help matters by chewing the scenery in a performance that's neither terrifying or funny.

              "       \"Star Wars is an institution of cinema, it's not just a movie (or movies) but is also a culturalphenomenon, a revolutionary franchise, a highlight in Hollywood's history and more. With anexcellent entertaining story, endearing characters (at least in the first three), spectacular andrevolutionary special effects, epic action sequences and the best score ever, this saga is trulyunique and amazing.While the first three films are all classics and modern masterpieces, the prequel trilogy issomewhat a mixed bag that does not achieve the hights of its predecessors but they are not asbad as many have claimed and they are still enjoyable in its own right.This BD set is one of the most, if not the most anticipated release in the HD format. When it wasfirst announced, many sentiments circulated around the net: joy, anger, anxiousness, etc. StarWars is such powerful that we, the people have strong reactions toward it. Of course, with a newrelease, there is also new controversy. First the bad news: the films presented here are newSpecial Editions that are closer to the vision George Lucas have for his films. I really don'tmind when directors go back to their previous work and do some changes as long as they give asthe option to choose the new version or the original release that everyone likes. George Lucas hasnever give us such option and that's what bothers me the most. I wouldn't mind the specialeditions if the original were also included (completely restored of course) and we were given theoption to choose. With Star Wars that has never been the case and as mad as I may be, I havelearned to live with the pain and live with the changes that can be very subtle or very obvious andstupid.I should warn you that if you absolutely don't tolerate the changes then don't buy this set. If you,like me have learned to tolerate them or don't care about them then this set is veryrecommended.I will review each film, their picture and sound quality and some of the changes that have beenmade.Prequel Trilogy (1999-2005)Ep. I: The Phantom Menace (1999)After Ep VI was released in 1983, the world has lived happily without a new Star Wars film for 16years. But when George Lucas announced that he was going to release a new Star Wars film thatwas going to be the first of a new trilogy, the world jumped with joy. Ep. I was one of the mostanticipated movies ever and the excitement was visible everywhere. When it was finally released,Ep I was not proclaimed as an instant classic like the previous film and many people feltdissapointed with what they saw on the screen. To be fair, the first three films were sacred goodsand Ep I had to reach impossibly high standards. But, that it's no excuse to deliver a film that wasa mixed bag from beginning to end. The picture has a lot of problems, one of them the actors. Idon't know what George saw in Jake Lloyd but he is no a good Anakin Skywalker. He is one of themain detractions of the film, which is bad because he is the main character and if you don't likehim, then the whole movie is hard to follow. The other big detraction and this may be the biggestone is the inclusion of the creature Jar Jar Binks. Many people have complained about the Ewokson Ep VI but the whole group of them are not as annoying as this creature. Jar Jar is such a badcharacter that comes close to ruining the whole film. Natalie Portman is an amzing actress bu hereshe seems a little aout of focus and uncomfortable. The best characters and performances are fromLiam Neeson and Ewan McGregor as the two jedi knights that save the day. Other problem is thatsome sequences are too long like the pod race which begins very good but then drags a lot andultimately becomes boring. The plot is too political and lacks the excitement that the previous filmshas and overall you never feel connected to the characters. On the positive side, the visuals areamazing with spectaucarl special effects, the actiln sequences are exciting, the lightsaber fights arefun much more dynamic and of course John Williams score is always of great help to all the films.TPM is has a lot of troubles but ultimately is still watchable and sometimes it is genuinely fun.Recommended.Movie: 3.5 stars.Ep II: Attack of the Clones (2002)After the lukewarm response to Ep. I, Ep. II was supposed to be a return to form for the franchiseand while is definetely an improvement over the previous film, it still has some troubles, mainlyone which can be said in two words: Hayden Christensen. How you can enjoy a movie when youabsolutely hate the main character? That's the main problem I have with this film, I can't standAnakin Skywalker. While the action sequences are better, the battles are bigger and moreinteresting and is great to see Yoda in action, Anakin is a real pain in the a**. Again, EwanMcGregor is the best character in the movie and you root for him instead of Hayden. But, noteverything is Hayden's fault. A lot of blame goes to Lucas who wrote the character as a stupid,stubborn, whiner. Natalie Portman is good but when she is with Hayden, their lack of chemistry isvery palpable. The love scenes are very ridicolous and you just can't help but laugj sometimes.What this movie does right, aside from the battles and special effects is that gives us more stellarperformances from supporting characters like Ian McDiarmid, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker,Christopher Lee and Samuel L. Jackson and of course there is no more Jar Jar. Is also great to seethe jedi order in its splendor fighting as a strong group. And of course Williams score is as alwaysexcellent.Ultimately, AOTC is fun to watch despite its problems and is better than Ep I. Recommended.Movie: 4 stars.Ep. III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)Now this is a return to form for the franchise. Ep III, which is easily the best of the prequel trilogy.Ep. III provides a satisfying conclusion to the saga and I can easily say that is a great film. Thestory is much darker and the action sequences are great. The battles between Anakin and Obi-Wan and between Yoda and The Emperor are simply amazing. Surprinsingly, Anakin is not asannoying as it was on the previous film and he fares better here. For a movie that you know whatwill happen, Ep. III is a fun ride and almost equal to Ep. VI. Highly Recommended.Movie: 4.5 stars.Original Trilogy (1977-1983)Star Wars (also called-Ep. IV: A New Hope  1977)Countless of things have been said about the original SW so I won't delve to much in it. Sufy tosay is that while no movie is perfect, this one comes pretty damn close, is a classic withunforgettable characters, a great story and special effects that are still spectacular to watch untilthis day. A masterpiece.Movie: 5 starsEp. V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)My favorite SW film and one of the best movies ever made, TESB is as perfect as the first film andeven better. Darker, with great performances, a wonderful twist and an unforgettable villain, thismovie is perfection 100%. Very Highly Recommended.Movie: 5 starsEp. VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)While this is the weakest film of the OT, is still a great film that gives a great conclusion to a greattrilogy. The main problem it seems to be the Ewoks but I don't find them that annoying (againwatch Ep I and we'll talk about who is really annoying). Ep VI is lighter than V but is also full ofthrills like the triple final battle, one in Endor, the other in outer space and the most important oneinside the Death Star. Ep. VI provides a perfect completion for a perfect trilogy. Very HighlyRecommended.Movie: 4.75 starsVideo & AudioEp I is the worst looking movie in the whole set. Much blame goes to DNR that makes the picturelooks weird. Faces are sometimes soft, night scenes are sometimes crushed but overall is not abad transfer. In fact, it has never looked better but it could have looked better if a better effortwas given.PQ: 3.5Attack of the clones look much better but still has some problems againwith softness and somecolors are not well reproduced. But, overall is a great transfer and I'm sure it will satisfy everyone.PQ: 4Revenge of the Sith is completely demo quality. Is as perfect as anything you will see. Aspectacular transfer.PQ: 5The original trilogy looks uniformily excellent. I was surprise that they did not eliminate all thegrain in the film like in Ep. I and there is a layer of it throughout the three films. Skin tones arewarm, colors are well reproduced and detail and contrast are spectacular. You will marvel at howgood the movies look. Some DNR is apparent in some scenes but overall the three movies havestellar transfers. I'm very happy with the results.PQ: 4.5Sound is spectacular in all six films. The 6.1 DTD-HD MA in the whole saga is dynamic, strong,clear and completely amazing. There is no sign of damage or hiss. This is a stellar mix for all thefilms.AQ: 5Changes:This edition has some new changes in the films:The best one and the only one that feels appropiate is the replacement of puppet Yoda for a CGione in Ep. I. Is far more pleasing than in the original release.The other changes unfortunately are again done in the OT. Fortunately two of them are not veryannoying. The first one is is Ep. IV where Obi-Wan's scream in the desert was changed andenhanced. The other is Ep. VI and now the Ewoks blink. Both changes are hardly noticeable.Unfortunately, the most annoying change, also happens in Ep. VI and now Darth Vader screamsNooo! before throwing the Emperor down the Death Star. This change is very stupid because theoriginal scene was perfecy buy you know what they say this comes close to George's vision...As for the previous changes, they are still there but now Han and Greedo shoot at the same time.At least now, this is closer to the vision we had of the scene. But for me, the most awful changewas the replacement of Sebastian Shaw for Hayden Christensen at the end of Ep. VI andunfortunately he is still there ruining the end of the movie. Thanks a lot George.Bonus FeaturesThis set comes with so many bonus material that you will have to see it for days. Everything isgreat and interesting.First, on discs I to VI, you have two audio commentaries, one from the previous DVD releases anda new one that is a compilation of archival interviews.On disc VII you have the archives for Ep. I-III where you will find interviews, model collections andconcept galleries for each film. Most important, you have 22 deleted scenes, 6 for Ep. I, 5 for Ep.II and 11 for Ep. III. This is the highlight of the disc and they should not be missed.On Disc VIII you have the Archives for Ep. IV-VI again with interviews, sculptures, models,concept galleries and 23 amazing deleted scenes, 8 for Ep. IV, 10 for Ep. V and 5 for Ep. VI. Theyare must see for everyone.On Disc 9 you have a variety of documentaries including three making of documentaries for the OTfilms, a documentary about the changes done in 1997 for the films re-release, a homage to troop501, a documentary about the SW creatures and a very fun one with all the parodies of SW.The bonus material is excellent and is clear that Lucasfilm put a very strong package. The onlydownside is that none of the DVd bonus material has been ported over, including the excellent'Empire of Dreams' documentary. Still, this new material, particularly the deleted scenes, isamazing ans will be a great treat to everyone.Closing ThoughtsThe Star Wars saga is one of the most legendary pieces of filmmaking ever made. While not all thefilms are perfect, overall the 6 films provide top-notch entertainment and deserve to be seen. Thisset is almost perfect with spectacular picture quality (most of the time), superb audio and plenty ofexcellent bonus material. The only downside are as always the changes done to the film and theexclusion of the DVD bonus material. Maybe some day we will see a definitive Star Wars set withthe inclusion of the originals but until then this set comes very highly recommended!!!\",\n",
              "       \"Jan de Bont tackles The Haunting as less of a remake of Robert Wise's original 1963 film and more of a fresh adaption of Shirley Jackson's novel but, unfortunately, de Bont's film is too literal; he wants to show us EVERYTHING. The lack of subtly is the undoing of this film. The only thing that the film gets right is in the area of casting with Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor and Owen Wilson nicely capturing what makes their characters tick.Sometimes what we don't see is much scary than what we DO see.The DVD looks fine--the transfer is a bit dated though and would benefit from a sharper, high def transfer. The featurette on the making of the film gives us a good idea as to what the director, cast and writer wanted to achieve but it fails to provide us much information as to WHY they did't achieve it although I suspect it is because de Bont had no understanding of what made Robert Wise's film work so well--the creepy psychological tension.Perhaps modern film fans will scoff at the original which hints at Theo being a lesbian and the fact that Nell is as haunted as the house itself witout any overwhelming horrific gore but there's something to be said for creating a mood vs. showing us every single bit of gore or CGI as most modern horror flicks do.\",\n",
              "       \"A film that balances nearly all aspects of literature and cinematic thrills is called No Country For Old Men.In a barren landscape Coens' masterpiece deals with the escalation of violence in a town at the border of Mexico, during the rise of drug smuggling in the eighties. Three fascinating characters are pitted against each other in a thriller that has both suspense and horror. The visuals are pure cinema and beautifully photographed with psychological overtones. In a script filled with characters that are unaffected and with others that are very much affected by the changing climate of their world, we witness a desperate man who steals drug money and is escaping within an inch of his life and another who is the epitome of evil incarnate, followed by a sheriff who is overwhelmed by the new face of crime. In one of those great literary moments a man is offered the shirt off someone else's back and what has been pure evil throughout this journey turns into a moment of surprise and compassion.\",\n",
              "       \"If the mark of a tremendous comedy is the ability to leave the audience quoting its funniest lines long after the end credits roll, than Anchorman is one of the greatest comedic masterpieces ever produced.For a basic plot summary, Anchorman is set in the 1970s TV news business, where anchormen rule the roost and women are not given the time of day.  As such, legendary anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) feels threatened when female reporter Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) doesn't back down under his comic machismo.Anchorman is a typical Will Ferrell move through and through.  That is, the humor comes from watching Ferrell recite the most hilarious of lines with the straightest of faces.  Almost every joke is completely ridiculous, but the fact that everyone plays it so straight is where the real humor arises.Also, Steve Carrell (and to a lesser extent other auxiliary cast members David Koechner & Paul Rudd, among others) nearly steals the show playing the sidekick role.  In one of Carrell's first film roles, he shows that his type of humor (in the same vein of Ferrell) would be around to stay.  Brick Tamland provides easily some of the most side-splitting material ever put to film.Overall, I consider Anchorman to be one of the funniest comedy films of all-time for one basic reason: it isn't a complete farce.  There are so intensely sexual, bodily secretion, or otherwise gross-out jokes in this film.  Just well thought-out and well-acted humor for the duration.\",\n",
              "       \"While some good directors never quite get it, it took Guillermo Del Toro only one misfire -- the icky, slow-paced Blade 2 -- to get the whole comic-book adaptation thing right.In fact, just about everything is right with Hellboy -- Del Toro crafted an action blockbuster with a grimy, slimy cult-movie feel and a quirky sense of humor. It's graced with excellent acting, spectacular action scenes, and the trappings of clockpunk and Lovecraftian horror -- not to mention that it stars a six-foot-tall scarlet demon with a soft spot for kittens.In 1944, young Professor Broom accompanied an army regiment to a remote Scottish island, where the Nazis -- led by Rasputin -- were about to open a portal to another world, and allow the vast tentacled Ogru Jahad (Seven Gods of Chaos) to enter our world. Rasputin and the Nazis were destroyed, but something came through the portal -- a baby demon, whom Broom names Hellboy.Fast-forward sixty years -- a grown Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and his fishy friend Abe (Doug Jones) are working at a paranormal government agency that specializes in policing the supernatural, with the weirded-out Agent Myers (Rupert Evans) just joining the team. Soon afterwards, Hellboy is called on to kill Sammael the Hellhound -- but it turns out that Sammael can replicate himself indefinitely.As Hellboy and his team try to hunt down the remaining Sammaels, the dying Professor Broom (John Hurt) finds that a revived Rasputin and his immortal Nazi followers have orchestrated all this. And Rasputin is continuing to pull the strings behind the scenes -- including using Hellboy's love Liz (Selma Blair), a depressed pyrokinetic. And when Hellboy suffers a devastating loss, his journey will take him right back to his roots -- and the potential destruction of the world.Watching Hellboy, it's easy to see how Guillermo Del Toro because world-famous for the exquisitely dark Pan's Labyrinth, and why he's been chosen to direct the forthcoming Hobbit movies. This adaptation could have just been another paint-by-numbers comic-book story, but Del Toro gives it the kind of grime, quirk, brains and heart that a lasting cult movie should have.Part of that cult appeal is Hellboy's distinctive look, with Lovecraftian tentacle-gods and some steampunky details. And the action scenes are pretty spectacular -- trains, slimy hellhounds, sword-swinging Nazis with chopped-up faces, giant clock cogs, and a fiery explosion in a mental asylum. And there are some truly spectacular action scenes in a vast underground labyrinth, full of ancient hammers and collapsing bridges. There's just enough action and grossness, without going overboard.But Del Toro is able to balance out the action with some truly touching moments, such as the aged Broom's final scenes in his firelit study. And there's a lot of dark humor here as well -- and not all of it is Hellboy's dry one-liners. The movie is liberally peppered with dark humor moments (1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45. DID he now?), including some hilariously macabre scenes involving a bad-tempered Russian zombie (This is Ivan Klimatovich. Say hi, Ivan. Go that way, Red Monkey!).Most importantly, Del Toro is able to give his characters little human quirks -- hair plugs, love of cats, and Hellboy sanding down his horns in the morning. Perlman is simply amazing as Red, whose gruff scarlet exterior hides a kindly, affectionate heart. Not many actors could emote through that many prosthetics (including a very lifelike tail), but Perlman makes it look natural.Though he's playing a ninetyish old professor, Hurt plays his role with a quiet, powerful sense of goodness. Jones and Evans also do excellent jobs, one as an erudite psychic fish-man (We lead a charmed life, he observes as cockroaches skitter around him) and an earnest young agent. Selma Blair is the one downside -- she sort of mumbles in a monotone most of the time.Hellboy is one of the best comic-book adaptations that Hollywood has turned out, primarily because of the darker, eerier aesthetic Guillermo Del Toro brings to it. Definitely a must-see.\",\n",
              "       \"... if it weren't so very very sad. It's a film that rubs the intolerable emptiness and shame of our thwarted little lives in our faces, and then tries to wipe away our tears with a posthumous paean to the beauty we failed to appreciate while we were living. It's the hollowness of that paean that perturbs me. A millisecond of epiphany after two hours of grief! Ah. What does it all mean? Are the screenwriter and director being viciously ironic/sardonic or are we in Kansas after all, Toto?Six characters in search of an Author? Great ensemble acting, let's acknowledge immediately! Lester Burnham, our narrator, announces his death in a voice-over in the first minute of the film, and in a sense the plot becomes a who'll do it, with every other character a candidate emotionally and with images of guns omnipresent. Lester is your seriously depressed 42-year-old male, who snaps. There's a hate-triangle in the Burnham household, of Lester, his frantic wife, and their 'emo' daughter. Then a second hate-triangle moves in next door, a ramrod Marine colonel, his catatonic wife, and their vampire son. Whoops, he's not a vampire, just an evolving sociopathic stoner, but this is a film that 'looks' like it should involve a vampire at some point. The Burnham daughter, a sullen Plain Jane, has a would-be Lolita best friend. That makes a septet of seven emotionally dischordant (sic) principals in a sexually a-tonal double fugue. Hey, is all that Hate really Love? The only people in the neighborhood who aren't emotionally dystonic are the two guys -- partners -- who live contentedly on the other side of the Burnham household. But the 'genius' of this film is that all these grotesque human miscreants are somehow pitifully plausible. But wow, I hope I'm not one of them!So who kills Lester? Of course I'm not going to tell! But really, the big question is 'why is Lester so happy being dead?'\",\n",
              "       \"The title calls to mind a landscape strewn with grave-robbing zombies but Don Siegel's 1956 film is an altogether more intellectual parable than most science fiction of the time. A young doctor in a Californian town experiences a rash of patients complaining their loved ones are impostors: identical in body and mind, but lacking in soul and emotion. Initially satisfied by the local shrink's reassurances that this is localised hysteria, Dr Bennel (the ironically named Kevin McCarthy) begins to smell a rat as more of his acquaintances are afflicted, and knows he's caught one when a friend discovers an almost completely formed replica on his pool table. From there much excitement is had as Dr Bennel realises he and his lady friend, a saucy Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter) are the only humans left in Santa Mira and the invaders - from an alien place, we can only surmise - are advanced in their planning to take this scheme nationwide.Invasion of the Body Snatchers is, common consensus will tell you, an allegory, although a hearty debate can be had about what: one school has it that Siegel has communism in his sights; another that it is in fact *anti-communist* hysteria that the film warns against. Siegel himself, on the other hand, disavowed all political readings. He maintained he was just trying to make a thriller.While it is difficult to imagine 1956 Hollywood having much truck with a McCarthyist agenda, it is harder to read Invasion of the Body Snatchers as the opposite: the enemy are the pods and the unseen, creeping brainwash they bring which saps a victim's passion, individuality and Americanism: straight out of Senator McCarthy's playbook. In any case there is more than a little irony, either way, that the only thing capable of saving the American way of life turns out to be the paternal hand of big central government in the shape of the FBI.It doesn't seem outrageous, therefore to take Siegel's denial at face value: he was just trying to make a thriller, and on a shoestring budget he made a good one, though it is not without its faults.The creeping paranoia established in early sequence is subtle and never overstated - there are no zombies or bug-eyed monsters here: the aliens are never explained and represented only by the now celebrated seed pods, which resemble nothing quite so much as stretcher-shaped and sized cabbages. Iconic though they may be, the purist in me feels that making the implied explicit by their inclusion was a mistake, particularly since the film changes its mind about what they represent halfway through: in early sequences the invaders are snatching bodies and replacing them with duplicates incubated in pods; by the end they're not snatching bodies at all, but infecting original ones while they sleep, with no need for a pod at all: a much more insidious and dreadful plan, if potentially less iconic.The film is bookended with a scene away from Santa Mira in which a raving Dr Benner, having escaped, struggles to convince medicos he's not mad. It seems this scene was added subsequently to ameliorate an ending Siegel thought too distressing. It is also this envelope which is responsible for the anti-McCarthyist ambiguity. For my money the film would be more powerful and memorable without it: a closing scene where Benner stumbles onto a streaming freeway only to see truck loads of pods being ferried across the land would have been a striking finale indeed.For science-fiction aficionados this flawed but involving film is a must-see, but for its historical context as much as its film craft.Olly Buxton\",\n",

Jeff Lebowski, a 40-somethng slacker who calls himself The Dude, has been confused with another Jeff Lebowski, who is a multi-millionaire with a high-spending wife. When thugs attack The Dude, thinking him to be the tycoon, an unlikely plot is set in motion in which The Dude is charged with coming up with the money the wife owes.TBL never stops spinning the unexpected. The Dude loves to bowl, and his team consists of an former Vietnam vet (John Goodman) and a hapless hanger-on (Steven Buscemi). Between them, the trio hardly has enough brain cells to flush the john, but lurch along, trying to save the girl while making some money or themselves. One things that's funny about the film: The Dude - pot-bound, vacuous and benign - emerges as the biggest adult. Goodman thinks he is the leader, but his wacky schemes almost always flop. Another funny thing is the gang of misfits the Coens assemble to tell their tale - a naked expressionist artists (Julianne Moore), a gang of gothy German nihilists, a mysterious cowboy (Sam Elliott) and a team of competitive bowlers led by a jumpsuit-clad man named  Jesus. What the film lacks in outright hilarity and topicality, it wins by the sheer audacity and skill of shaping this gang of weirdos into a semi-coherent storyline.Worth seeing, whatever it's about.\",\n",

What Fred doesn't realize, though, is that he's also Bob, the target of his own investigation, the area supplier of D, which has vicious side effects including the split personality that prevents the agent's alter egos from knowing each other.Woody Harrelson, Rory Cochrane and Robert Downey Jr. play drug users in Bob's world, and their antics and banter are brilliant and funny, and lend to the surreal atmosphere of the premise and the animation. It all works very well.Extras include a commentary track with Linklater, Reeves and the author's daughter, who has wonderful insights to contribute; two behind-the-scenes features, one a making-of and one about the animation.If you already know the novel and are not a purist, you should really appreciate this adaptation; if you haven't read the book you may feel a little lost, but you will probably enjoy it anyway; if you are a Dick purist, you may find the film lacking but may enjoy the input from the author's daughter and might benefit from lightening up.\",\n",

Truffaut makes a statement about indifference in society and the inexperience and irresponsibility of immature parenting, like no other film I've ever seen. It is an experience like no other on celluloid. Truffaut's film is in the truest and sincerest sense a new voice not just a new wave.\",\n",

Unable to match their firepower, Ofelia turns to imagination and magic instead.

Red October admittedly paints the Russians in a very secretive light, but such treatment isn't unfair and the Americans on the other side of the ocean are hardly championed as the infallible superheroes they portray in many similar pictures (and Clancy's original book). Despite a few technical flubs, the tale is plenty smart and generally authentic, but also easy enough for a layperson to follow. It's not an easy act to merge simplistic storytelling with a complicated plot, but director John McTiernan manages to deliver both without shortchanging either. An excellent sense of timing and steady, effective pace are most responsible for that success; though a great majority of the film is lost to dialog, the action is spaced out enough to keep the audience routinely on its toes. Sean Connery is a tough sell as the Russian captain at the center of the storm, particularly as he makes no effort to hide his Scottish accent, but his charisma and conviction still manage to transform a fairly passive character into a stern, take-no-excuses captain with a pointed political message. Alec Baldwin's cautious, vanilla performance as famed protagonist Jack Ryan is less impressive, but serviceable.\",\n",

The story line is just about adequate to hang the punch lines on, but that is almost irrelevant, the important thing being to enjoy the competitive thrust of the dialog. It's more than a little like a Hope-Crosby outing in a skit which has no other purpose than to give them a framework for put-downs.

              "       \"There hasn't been a whole lot of fanfare, but for fans of Dave Stevens' graphic novels and Joe Johnston's 1991 Disney big-screen spectacular, the appearance of The Rocketeer on Blu-ray is somewhat of an event.On the package is a sticker proclaiming, From the director of Captain America. Clearly this release is piggybacking on the successful 2011 film -- and the two films seem, at least to me, inextricably linked by their setting and their director.But why did The Rocketeer run out of propellant while Captain America blasted the box office? The most obvious reason is that the Marvel character has had more mainstream visibility, though the '60s cartoon and '70s live-action series incarnations of Captain America were not exactly stellar. It's also a tricky matter to set a film in WWII, or during the '40s and make it resound with younger audiences.Just because The Rocketeer wasn't a smash, it isn't fair to dismiss it as some did back in the '90s. Actually, it's quite a fine film, with a likable cast led by Billy Campbell, Jennifer Connelly and Alan Arkin, as well as a scene-chewing tour-de-force performance by Timothy Dalton -- clearly having a grand old time playing a thorough rotter.The Rocketeer has very good effects for its time, superb art direction and photography, and one of the best background scores of the last several decades. I highly recommend the soundtrack album of James Horner's sweeping score. You can also hear this music as the Epcot fountains dance regularly, as well as in countless movie trailers for other releases.Hopes were just a little too high for The Rocketeer. Disney was looking for a huge franchise, so a well-done, nicely received film wouldn't cut it. Even though Johnston only mentions The Rocketeer once briefly in his Captain America commentary (alas, he did not do one for The Rocketeer Blu-ray -- there are no extras to speak of), clearly the director learned and developed over the years.Perhaps the main issue between the two films is tone. The Rocketeer is highly stylized and inconsistently campy with a hero who's a little too cocky for his own good, while Captain America is a hybrid between retro, comic book and contemporary action movie style, with a much more sympathetic hero.But if you haven't seen The Rocketeer in Blu-ray, prepare for a treat. The spot-on animated sequence, the lavish nightclub scene, and even the sarcophagus-like dwelling of the villain are as vivid as can be. You just have to approach The Rocketeer as a jaunty romp and enjoy the ride.\",\n",
              "       \"Star Wars Episode II is perhaps the most awful of the entire prequel trilogy, simply due to the fact that we get 2 1/2 hours of completely epic boredom. This film picks us up about 10 years after Episode I, where little Anakin is all grown up, Obi-wan and him have not only developed a relationship, but also have done so much together in terms of training that we sadly as the audience never actually get to see any of it, but it is all explained very simply during a 60 second scene with Anakin and Obi-wan in an elevator. It almost makes Episode I completely senseless to have even made (even by George Lucas' mouth, he didn't like Episode I either, as he's said several times). In this film, we follow a darkening Anakin as he becomes ever so closer with the former Queen Amadala, played by Natalie Portman (who is perhaps the most appealing thing about this film considering all her very attractive and sensuously revealing outfits).The entire movie follows a political plot struggle between the jedi and the empire, with special effects that took almost no REAL filming or manpower to create, except all being a completely endless (ENDLESS!) nausea-inducing, color confusing flashes of special effects. It's all displayed to be similar to a war movie, yet without any heart and soul whatsoever in accordance with it. What's even sadder is that these action scenes are too few and far between, and unfortunately drowned out by the endless and constant whining and head-ache eye-roll inducing romance love story between Anakin and Padmay (Natalie Portman).Shortly put - Hayden Christianson's acting is beyond horrid, ridiculously stiff, horrifically written (which is not his own fault), and completely miscast. While Natalie Portman is far beyond a better actor, she also is dealt with not necessarily bad lines, but a character who comes off as smart in her presentation but is so oblivious to her circumstances that it's a shock she ever became Queen. Her character overall is simply terrible. While I'm glad she's not the monotone robot here she was in Episode I, she still is just borderline likable. To put it another way, George Lucas hasn't the faintest clue on how to write a romance, as this is without the doubt the most terribly awful romance love story I've ever seen unfold. But still, for the sake of the birth of Luke and Leia Skywalker, Anakin and Padmay had to get together.By the end, this is just completely boring, you may fall asleep even watching it. Sure there are perhaps 1 or 2 (maybe just 1 actually) battle scenes that are pretty decent, but nothing that has any real foundational plot significance to really get you to care anyway.

              "       \"After excelling as cinema's most malevolent femme fatale - bleached-blonde, anklet-wearing Phyllis Dietrichson - in Billy Wilder's classic 1944 noir,Double Indemnity, Barbara Stanwyck was understandably looking for something lighter to balance out her enduring screen image at the time. Finding instant relief in this 1945 screwball farce that has since become a holiday TV staple, she plays Elizabeth Lane, a popular homemaking magazine writer who doles out Martha Stewart-type cooking advice to the unsuspecting masses who haven't a clue that she's really a lonely working girl who lives in a cold-water Manhattan flat. Things get immediately complicated when her demanding publisher Alexander Yardley, desperate for a boost in circulation, insists that she entertain a wounded soldier who fantasized about her bountiful dishes out in the Pacific. The problem is compounded by the fact that she has completely fabricated her life of domestic bliss on a Connecticut farm where she is supposed to be happily married with a baby.Yardley is not aware of her web of deception, so Elizabeth uses the luxuriant farm owned by her paramour wannabe, John Sloan, whom she agrees to marry in return even though she doesn't love him. She convinces her best friend Felix, a first-class Hungarian chef who has been plying her with his recipes, to come to the farm to give her a crash cooking course. Needless to say, bedlam ensues when the soldier, Jefferson Jones, shows up at the farm two hours early, but of course, so does romance eventually at a local dance and then on a most romantic sleigh ride. Love and truth eventually sort themselves out at the end. In a strange way, one could look at this holiday rom-com as the flip side toDouble Indemnitysince both revolve around the concept of a woman fooling others to get her way, but this time, she's a single gal who wants a husband instead of a married one who wants to dispose of one. Directed by Warner Bros. studio journeyman Peter Godfrey and co-written by Lionel Houser and Adele Comandini, the film lacks a certain finesse that an Ernst Lubitsch (The Shop Around the Corner) would have provided in spades.What's more, the initial set-up feels tacked-on with the food-fantasizing Jones first on a life raft with a fellow soldier, then getting rescued, and gradually recovering in the hospital. It runs perilously close to a half-hour before we even get a glimpse of Stanwyck's character. That's a bit of a shame since she's terrifically likeable and a game farceur in her typical no-nonsense way. A studio favorite at the time, former band singer Dennis Morgan (In This Our Life) plays the smitten Jones well enough in an undemanding role. The usually menacing Sydney Greenstreet (Maltese Falcon) has a good time playing the pompous Yardley, and the unforgettable S.Z. Cuddles Sakall (Casablanca) lives up to his name as Felix. Memorable as the Southern-fried, skirt-blowing chanteuse inThe Awful Truth, Joyce Compton plays the nurse who attempts to entrap the food-desperate Jones into marriage. The 2005 DVD includes the original theatrical trailer and an Oscar-winning short, Star in the Night, a then-contemporary retelling of the Nativity story set in the Southwest desert.\",\n",

It makes the dialogue from Disturbing Behavior almost Shakespearean.Beyond the unignorable script is a braindead plot that involves a little bit of Carrie, some faux Devil worship, and Megan Fox in a lot of outfits that make viewers wish that some of the fabric covering her body were covering her mouth.

They also played together in the Raymond Chandler Phillip Marlowe detective noir classic, The Big Sleep and in Key Largo. In this Dark Passage pairing though, while still in thrall with each other off-screen, the steam is fading, fading fast. But not, perhaps, because of their familiarity to movie-goers as much as the plot line they had to perform under.Let me explain a little. Vincent Parry (played by Bogart) is in stir up at Quentin for the foul murder of his wife. But, see, like they all say, he didn't do it so he lams out of Q on his own to see if he can get out from under the life sentence he had received. So naturally when the cops are on his trail up shows Irene Jansen (played by Bacall) to help him out. Seems that, for reasons of her own, she followed Vincent's trial closely and is convinced that he might be innocent. So she hid him out at her place for a while until things got too hot. But getting out from under this life sentence is going to be harder than you would think. So while riding in a cab to another hide-out he is picked up by a friendly, very friendly cabbie who just happens to know  a back alley plastic surgeon who will change Vincent's face enough so that he can work without notoriety. Simple right.Well the long and short of it is that while the facelift might have seemed like the answer to his problems everybody and their brother is on to him in the end. And as finding the  the real murderer. Well she inconveniently falls out the window of her high rise apartment. While Vincent is there trying to talk sense into her. So, knowing he can't win, new face and all, he lams it for parts south, way south.So you can see what I mean by the awkwardness of the main plot line. And what makes said plot lines even worst is that Irene has a big crush on Vincent, under either old or new face. Except, and here is the real crime, we do not see either face until fairly late in the film and by then any sense of the magic of To Have Or Have Not or The Big Sleep has dissolved into the be-bop 1940s crime noir night. Too bad.\",\n",

He comes across as just so likable. Okay, he also comes across as a vicious sociopath when his Dark Passenger is allowed to peek out. But the showrunners did a very smart thing by allowing Dexter to narrate his own story. Privy to his thoughts, we observe his wicked sense of humor, which he mostly internalizes. And no his humor doesn't necessarily make him human, but it makes him more relatable. Dexter is very much aware of his limits, of how he struggles with social cues. We note a strange thing. Dexter occasionally finds himself conflicted now, between the pull of his girlfriend and her kids and his murderous urges. This third season Dexter veers dangerously away from the Code of Harry. He lets someone in. It bites him in the butt. Very unconventional behavior for a neat, orderly monster like Dexter.Safe again is Dexter as this new season opens. Last season he almost lost everything when his bags of body bits turned up off the coast of Miami and the media dubbed him The Bay Harbor Butcher (a nickname Dexter considers crass). But Dexter managed to elude the FBI-led manhunt, managed to pin his dark deeds on someone else. It helps a lot that Dex is entrenched in Miami Metro PD, working as the blood spatter expert. So he escaped unscathed, safe again. Except that now, somewhere in Miami, someone is skinning his victims alive. Dexter's Dark Passenger is licking its lips.And yet it must be so vexing having to maintain a perpetual mask. If you have to summarize this season with a sentence, it may be: Dexter makes a friend. You almost can't blame Dexter's eventual caving in when the Assistant DA Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits) extends a hand of friendship, what with Dexter having shown kindness when Miguel's brother was murdered (never mind that it was Dexter who murdered him). This series thrives on its character-driven story arcs, allowing the strong performances of its lead and supporting cast and its featured guest star to anchor the strange plot twists and turns. I've said this elsewhere, but Jennifer Carpenter as Dexter's insecure cop sister, Debra Morgan, is a stand-out for me. Carpenter expertly juggles her character's profuse profanity, bonehead impulses, her big heart and aching vulnerability. It sucks that, this time out, she gets saddled with a tepid love interest and an extremely annoying Internal Affairs officer who keeps nagging Deb to spy on her cop partner. Another bit of suck? The Skinner makes for a pretty weak recurring villain.Series 3 explores two particular themes. We see Dexter and Miguel's friendship blossom and then take a strange, dangerous turn. We also watch Dexter cope with the notion that he's about to be a father, what with Rita (Julie Benz), his damaged goods of a girlfriend, pregnant with his child. Can Dexter have it all? A convincing semblance of normality for him to blend in, as well as his extracurricular activities as Miami's unknown top predator? It won't be easy as Dexter finds himself torn. He genuinely likes Rita and her kids, and that pretense, that cover, is threatening to become the real thing. His Dark Passenger fights him every inch of the way, demanding that certain cravings be sated. Michael C. Hall and Jimmy Smits' give and take makes for compelling viewing. There's a certain gratification drawn from seeing Smits' playing against type, getting down and dirty and so fierce. Only, if you think Jimmy Smits' performance is the bee's knees, wait on Season 4 for John Lithgow's sublime turn as the Trinity Killer.\",\n",

              "       \"TITANIC, that preposterously beautiful film made in 1997 with a very young Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet, James Cameron's Magnum Opus, continues to impress, especially when viewed yet again on New Year's Day 2012 - a fifteen year old film that remains one of the most impressive cinematic achievements from Hollywood. One of the many reasons it remains resonant is the manner in which the film addresses class systems - the wealthy versus the poor is a hot topic today and the film shows us why - and the extraordinary cinematic recreation of the sinking of that mighty ship.But for many the manner in which Cameron sets the tone of the story, the reminiscence of the elderly Rose unraveling the tale to her granddaughter and crew of ship Keldysh attempting to raise the Titanic now 84 years on the bottom of the ocean and carrying that theme through the course of the film, seems more cogent today than even at movie's release.  Gloria Stewart is radiant as the old Rose and her rapt audience includes Bill Paxton, Suzy Amis, Lewis Abernathy, Nicholas Cascone, and Anatoly M. Sagalevitch.  From there the opulence of the 'unsinkable' Titanic unfolds and the gradual love affair between Rose Bukater (Kate Winslet) and poor artist Jack Dawson (Leonardo Di Caprio), a relationship at risk from the brewings of Rose's mother (Frances Farmer) and Rose's intended (Billly Zane). The cruise lasted from April 10, 1912 to April 15, 1912, but it was a lifetime of commitment between the young lovers.In retrospect the performances by some fine actors who would continue to rise is of note: Ioan Gruffudd, Victor Garber, David Warner, Danny Nucci etc.  The film could have used some editing to reduce the length, and the presence of the unsinkable Molly Brown (Kathy Bates in a wasted role) though historically accurate ads very little to the film and even distracts a bit.  Still TITANIC is just that - titanic - and no matter how many times we see it, it never fails to impress.  Grady Harp, January 12\",\n",

Thus we have Freud finding universal truths anew in theOedipus Trilogyand thus may our Occupy movement find things which are very interesting about this half century old film set in the Depression era, when the 99% lived helpless in Hoover-villes.In fact one of the most effective scenes in this multi-faceted movie occurs in just such a Hoover-ville, a homeless encampment made of rags like something from the Sudan, which is the only place the B&C; gang receive a welcome, a warm pail of soup, blankets and love.Everywhere else it is raining lead.Take a good look at this movie now as we pass another incredibly cruel time of inexorable poverty and national bankruptcy, in which the wealthy enjoy great luxury and the rest of us do without. Consider the education of Clyde and how he got there, and look for our new Clydes, and Bonnies. The only thing is the press is so fully controlled now that we never hear of them. The press is totally owned now, by the wealthiest, like our government, and cannot allow any folk heroes like Bonnie and Clyde setting an example for the rest. All those gangstah rappahs just join the elite, and don't pass out blankets to old ladies in the park.But do not get me started. This is a great movie, with much to say to us today. Watch it carefully, and think about where we are now.We can watch it from our own perspective, while we watch it from the perspective of that historical time in Texas in the Depression, and while we watch from the perspective of the time in which it was made and brought out for screening, when Warners went Seven Arts and King got killed.Lots of folks got shot, and publicly, like the bloody public executions of the Kennedy's.We saw a lot of blood on our screens at that time, yet this rather tame movie was allegedly damned for its violence.The great thing about the two disk special edition is that it includes a lot of related materials. Okay so we could do without the many long wardrobe try outs showing Beatty standing, but the rest is just great. You really get a look at the relationship of actors and directors and producers and movie studio boss. You get to see a few justifiably deleted scenes, or early establishing takes of a scene. And you get to hear about the amazing things that actually did make it into the movie, like the flying scalp.One of the greatest and most tragic aspects of watching the Jack Kennedy's assassination is Jackie's courageous attempt to climb out on to the trunk of the limousine to recover a large piece of JFK's scalp, cranium and brain, as if the medical procedures of the time could replace them where they belong. All she could do was to try.So when it came time (AND NO SPOILER HERE AS WE ALL KNOW THE ENDING) they tried very hard, with all of the squibs and other effects, to have some scalp blown off, and in the movie you really do not see it. But here we hear about it, without any overt reference to JFK's assassination. But we get it.And how about that ending. Just like with life, at the point of death, it is over, and so is this movie, although we feel it must go on (as Hackman discusses in the commentary on Disk Two) but, bam, it just ends, like life, and we who live try to go on.There are many ramifications to this excellent film which reward careful consideration, and I am very grateful, as always to my old friend (yeah, right) the influential director Alex Cox for mentioning he is teaching this film right now in his classes in Boulder. What I would not give to be a fly on that wall . . .When the little man fought back, with style.I wish I could find the entire poem written by Bonnie, which ends so poignantly, the one read here so well by the amazing Faye Dunaway, which ends:Some day they'll go down together;And they'll bury them side by side;To few it'll be griefTo the law a reliefBut it's death for Bonnie and Clyde. Guess you have to read the whole poem to see the power of these few lines, including the part of how the most people (robbed and dispossessed by the bankers and railroads and powerful monopolists the one percenters of their day) supported Bonnie and Clyde, or hear Faye read these few simple lines, in this wonderful film.There is much to like here and much to learn.Wow, what happened to Pollard?\",\n",
              "       \"The major problem with this biographical movie - other than Stewart's anesthetized performance - is the continual attempt to shock the audience instead of simply telling the story of The Runaways' struggles on the way toward success.  Instead, it's mostly the sex and drugs, and Joan Jett's apparent attempt to scissor every other members of the band.  And by other members of the band, I'm only talking about Cherrie Currie, because apparently Lita Ford, Sandy West, and Jackie Fox (who did not want to be involved) were supplementary at best.  At least Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon's performance is mesmerizing in its psychosis and conceit) had some depth and personality to it, because other than that, the movie has minimal positive aspects.  Kristen Stewart's endless supply of cigarettes do what her performance couldn't, smolder.  Which is quite bad when considering the source material.  Dakota Fanning's realistic, albeit boring performance exudes the immaturity and minimal talent of Currie.The screenplay is far too inconsistent, has no consistently resonating theme, no real lessons learned and the beginning drags like a plow.  Not that there weren't attempts at story-telling.  In one failure Jett's difficulties of breaking into a male-dominated rock industry are displayed; we see Kristen Stewart molest a guitar and assault the ears of a music teacher (Dimone from Fast Times at Ridgemont High) with what appeared to be a grand mal seizure with a pick.  It wasn't about overcoming male restrictions.  It was about her sounding horrible at that time.  She needed practice.  Another sequence shows the girls on the road, sharing bedrooms at a motel I wouldn't frequent without first examining the sheets with a black light.  Later still, the band gets upset at Currie for a PG-13 photo spread.  While the challenges follow reality, they do nothing for the continuity purposes of a film.  Especially when lingering questions abound (i.e. barely a hiccup on why Currie quit).The promising aspects of the movie are the music and the design.  Bravo to the set and costume design, because it felt like I was in a grungy punk-club in the late 70s.  From the lighting to the clothing, all visual aspects were realistic and interesting.What I wanted was sex, drugs, and rock and roll, but if the drug is Lunesta the impact is minimized.\",\n",
              "       \"Rather than his usual niche market of perversity and naked violence, Cronenberg has made an excellent arthouse film about the struggle of a disturbed man who returns home.  Fiennes is Mr. Cleg, a schizophrenic man who has left a mental asylum for the first time since his childhood.  Checking into a halfway house in his old neighborhood, run by a tough old matron, he goes about exploring his childhood haunts, mixing past and present in painful recollections of some kind of a trauma.  This technique is extremely effective in showing not just the disarray of his mind, but also his slippery hold on reality.The story that emerges has meaning, i.e. his illness is not merely a chemical imbalance but linked to experience.  As it unfolds, he portrays his family:  a loving mother, a cold and apparently abusive father, whose relationship with a local hooker disrupts their home.  All the while, Cleg is writing down his ideas in code in a tiny notebook that he hides.  As the process progresses, the viewer can see how he is fighting to see the truth, in spite of the lies he has weaved around himself like the webs that obsess him.  It is remarkable how well each piece fits as in a puzzle.  When it emerges, the truth is far worse than what he imagined (which I won't give away).Fiennes is amazing in the role.  He has to show all the inner turmoil by his gestures and posture, which exude the broken state of his self and mind.  It is so believable it is painful to watch.I would recommend renting this - you won't want to watch it again.  But it is a masterpiece.\",\n",

              "       \"Billy Wilder's iconoclastic style of filmmaking is at its best in the APARTMENT, a film that is almost an anti-romantic comedy that watches like a classic suspense thriller.  At times it is indeed very funny, but at the same time its tragic, melodramatic and makes you think deeply about human relationships... Its also interesting because it takes place in the generation of Mad Men and How To Succeed In Business -- reflecting some of the cynical views of the vain and sexist corporate culture that are now norms in mainstream thought, but digs a little deeper, walking a fine line.  Shirley MacLaine's character, through much of the film is sad and tragic, MacMurray plays a self centered, vile hypocritical jerk -- Lemmon is a likable, if not pitiful schlemiel type... but the screenplay balances out the story so that the any extreme's of the character's behavior fall into the story as a whole and don't steal the show making it any one actor's vehicle.  -- MacMurray's awkwardly heartless and jerky character as a result, is not a scene stealing villian, MacClaine's tragic sadness doesn't steal the film so as to make it her vehicle... nor does Lemmon's comic acting does not turn the film into a silly dainty rompy comedy although all of the cast are at the top of their form... The acting styles of the characters are all so different, yet fall into place, and this is the GENIUS of the film... that such very different characters can fit into a story with such perfect coherence.  (NOTE -- I'm being vague so as not to spoil the story.)In addition to the incredible screenplay and well utilized ensemble, the editing and cinematography are so well done, time is suspended... over 2 hours, the film unfolds more like a thriller as we truly are pulled into the world of Wilder's dysfunctional love triangles.  The (then) contemporary setting of the story leaves the modern viewer with an added breathtaking and engaging view of cool, hip, swinging  NY circa 1959 and 1960), definitely making then film even stronger watched 50 years later.As another reviewer points out; however, in many ways the film is poorly marketed.  To describe the film as a comedy is somewhat deceptive.  A tragi-comedy perhaps... but then again, even that could be argued about.  In the end, what it is is a masterpiece that simply transcends all genres and effectively tells a powerfully engaging story. To this extent, I'd have to rank it as an all time favorite and would definitely recommend buying it (not renting it) as a keeper!\",\n",

              "       \"LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS: THE OWLS OF GA'HOOLE flaunts an ungainly title and a cumbersome unfolding of  narrative. But, geez, it's so pretty to look at. The visuals are absolutely stunning, and it's a shame that the filmmakers couldn't invest as much in its ho-hum storytelling. It strives for an epic feel, but I think falls just short of grandeur. It features the coming-of-age tale of the owlet Soren. Soren has long been entranced by his father's tales of the Guardians of Ga'Hoole, them legendary owl warriors who once waged a great war against the despicable Pure Ones.So far Soren has led a dull, sheltered life. He can't even fly all that well as yet. But one bout of oneupmanship too many with his more skilled brother, Kludd, results in their plummeting from their treetop home and onto the woodsy bottom. And owls have no place being on the ground, where they're rendered exceedingly vulnerable. Soren and Kludd are owlnapped and taken to the stronghold of the Pure Ones, them renegade owls still bent on enslaving the rest of their brethern. Their preferred method is to expose their victims to the moon's influence, moon-blinking they calls it, the moon in essence stupefying the unwary and transforming them into zombie work drones.But I'm going on and on about a pretty generic plot. Suffice it to say, brother Kludd opts to stay with the Pure Ones, is enlisted in their savage troops. Soren escapes and embarks on a quest to locate the Owls of Ga'Hoole, to warn them about the Pure Ones. Along the way, Soren meets several companions, establishes a fellowship (this is mandatory in heroic quests). Thank goodness for the burly Twilight and Soren's snake nursemaid, Mrs. P. They provide most of what humor there is. This epic is so determinedly earnest and somber that even J.R.R. Tolkien thinks it needs to lighten up. Tack on characters with no grace notes and unfolding events that failed to draw me in and, really, the breathtaking animation is the sole reason to recommend this film. This is a visual spectacle in which to bask your eyeballs. Else, take the plot and the characters and the tired dialogue, and insert a live action format, and I think what you have is something the Sci-Fi Channel would be proud to call its own.Parents, be warned that while there is no blood or gore, the film doesn't shy from rolling out scenes of fierce owl-on-owl violence. In this narrative, death is very much part of the order of things. Only, it's a higher evolved circle of life, what with various birds clad in armor and tearing adversaries with vicious metal talons. There are some very dynamic action sequences, not the least of which is Soren's harrowing showdown with Metal Beak, the malevolent chieftain of the Pure Ones. I wished I cared more about who won this death match. I guess I'm edging towards Soren, even though he makes Frodo Baggins seem breezy. But I harbor mad respect for Metal Beak whose creepy metal accoutrements make him look downright scary. You gaze at Metal Beak and you don't doubt he's capable of serious, er, foul play. Except that in a children's story, villains aren't allowed to win, so suck on that, Metal Beak. 3 or 3.5 stars out of 5 for this one, with its animated virtuosity and disappointing storytelling.\",\n",
              "       \"At the beginning of REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, director Aronofsky forces you to participate, to become both a victim & accomplice of his film. I don't see how the device he uses would have the same impact in a theatre setting. I won't spoil the effect for people who haven't seen the film at home.Ellen Burstyn is very gutsy to have taken on the role of a mother turned psychotic by prescription uppers to lose weight. Her characterization defines tour de force. In effect she plays two roles: the role of a middle-aged woman who gets hooked on speed, and the bizarre & hypersexualized woman on TV. What starts out as humorous & quirky, quickly becomes deadly serious. It was her extraordinary performance that influenced my rating from what would have been 3 stars to 4. She gets 5.The son, his girl friend, and a male friend are all addicted to heroin. Their spiral downward coincides with that of the mother's, but from separate locations as all communication breaks down. Only the son & his male friend remain on speaking term--and even that's soon busted up by increasingly horrific ocurrences.The main theme of the movie is naturally that of drug induced social alienation. The two lovers, so close at the beginning, become completely driven apart by their addiction. This process was very effectiively presented & played out by the 3 young actors. I thought they were all very good.REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, unfortunately, goes way over the top about halfway through as addiction overwhelms reality. It's like throwing a barrage of images at a celluloid wall just see what sticks. What begins as a valid & visceral social commentary, descends into horror melodrama. Aronofksy is a very interesting director, this film just misses the level of greatness he is obviously capable of creating.\",\n",

              "       \"It is arguable that Dead Poet's Society can be called Robin Williams' best film, or his best performance, but doing so only diminishes much of his other impressive work on film and television (and for those lucky enough to have seen him, on stage). I would go as far as to say that Dead Poet's Society is probably the best dramatic film from the heydey of Disney's then-emerging Touchstone division.The film's audio commentary (thank you!) is chock full of interesting facts. Screenwriter Tom Schulman talks about how several studio executives held a meeting in which they were going to go over pages of notes with endless comments and changes -- then Jeffrey Katzenberg glanced through the pages and told Schulman to go ahead and make the film as written.The finished film is the subject of some discourse, because what we saw in the theaters back in 1989 is shorter than what appeared on the director's cut on laserdisc. Several of the edited scenes (perhaps not all, I'm not sure) are available on the special features section of the Blu-ray. You can make your own decision about whether these scenes should have stayed, but to me, the movie that I saw and never forgot in 1989 is the film as presented here.Except that when I saw it, the film did not look or sound like it does on this Blu-ray. Director Peter Weir is a very contemplative filmmaker, prone to capturing scenery and moments that establish various moods. Many of these extraordinarily beautiful scenes of Delaware in the fall and winter are downright dazzling on Blu-ray.Back to the movie itself, though -- it has not lost any of its impact in the ensuing years. Williams' character of Prof. Keating is not the hellbent-for-conflict hummingbird he played in Good Morning Vietnam (though in Dead Poet's Society, he gets just a few minutes to do some of his iconic shtick). There is amazing depth in his silence as well as his inspiring speech, almost an internal battle between what life can be and what life has dealt him (even though we get little hint of that in the narrative).Every member of the cast rises to the occasion, particularly one of the best actors now on television, Robert Sean Leonard, who artfully plays the best (only?) friend of Hugh Laurie in the long-running series, House.One of the most thankless performances in the movie is that of Kurtwood Smith, also handled masterfully: as Leonard's immovable father, brings dimension to a very unlikable role. Again, that draws attention to how different an edited film can be from a director's cut -- there is one deleted scene between Smith and Williams from the last act that, had it remained, would have made a huge difference in the perception of both characters. It's helpful that we get a featurette on the bonus materials (clearly from an earlier DVD) in which the creative people discuss how they approached the challenges.Weir explains that he deliberately avoided clear-cut answers in the film. Keating tells young, impressionable teens to reach beyond their grasp, as did the legendary people he quotes. He doesn't warn them that those visionaries paid their prices in one way or another. When some of these teens take chances, only some succeed, just as in real life. Is it worth it? What a great discussion this opens for parents and their kids.In its context of late-1950's McCarthyism, perched at the edge of cultural revolution in the '60s, Keating is an outspoken voice before it was cool. In today's world of extremes from one spectrum of propriety to another, as well as political correctness, one might wonder how he would fare.\",\n",

Gluck's made a film that will appeal to a number of different demographics without insulting or boring the others.  Ms. Stone is winning and compelling here (feisty and clearly whip-smart), but it was the whole ensemble - especially the adults - that endeared me to this film.  Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson win - hands-down - best parents of teen protagonist.  They're a hoot together turning what could be banal scenes into small, comedic masterpieces.

Joining her for a chopping spree are Barbara Crampton (Re-Animator), Russell Todd (Friday the 13th Pt. 2), and of course, Dick Miller, without whom, no '80s horror film would be complete. The plot is pretty cut and dry, and the film -- clocking in at about 75 minutes -- doesn't waste any time whatsoever. Within the first fifteen minutes, the killbots are electrocuting a bitter janitor and blowing the heads off of shallow teenage girls. From there, it's up to the remaining group of teenagers to find resourceful ways of dispatching of their would-be terminators.  Throughout all the shenanigans, Wynorski tries to keep a certain level of tension, but can't help but give in to sheer campiness in the end. The blatantly low budget doesn't help matters much, and in the end, the film is played for laughs more than anything.While admittedly low on substance, Chopping Mall is exactly the kind of b-flick you put in when you want to drift away with a few drinks and have a good time.

The plot as a whole, along with the imagery that carries it, comes across as fresh despite its familiar elements.Although adults can enjoy Miyazaki's animations at many levels, he intends them for kids, too. This time, the target age appears to be five or so, the age of the boy (Sosuke) who costars in this feature. As such, the mood stays lighter than in some of Miyazaki's other films, and there's a big kid-power message as well. His light touch keeps the serious issues from becoming grim, though. This is an entertainment before anything else. Although not as striking asPrincess MononokeorSpirited Away, it certainly entertains.--wiredweird\",\n",
              "       \"This movie's brilliance lies in its accuracy. Somehow, the Wild Things of Sendak's classic favorite truly come to life on screen, just as they appeared in the charming children's book. A lot had to be added to fill the brief book out to the length of a feature movie, but certainly nothing was taken away.Jonze also did a remarkably accurate job in rendering the imaginative small boy, Max, around whom the movie revolves. Like so many, he crosses freely over the line between fantasy and reality - maybe more freely than some, and maybe more freely than is really good for him. Jonze's accuracy carries a chill behind its warmth, though. Max gets carried away a bit too often, and has to deal with the complexities of growing up. Like so many, he really doesn't have the tools to deal with them, and strategies from his younger years no longer do what he needs done. It's easy to idealize a young boy's life in terms of imagination and adventure, but Jonze reminds us that boys have plenty of problems trying to make a place in a world full of people bigger and more experienced than they are.It's a beautiful movie and a brilliant rendering of Sendak's work. My lasting impression of the movie, however, is a very grown-up reminder that Max's life includes complexities that he has yet to master.-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release\",\n",

The ever-changing cast, whose major players never last long enough to settle down and get comfortable, makes it an act with several faces but no identity.

Their marriage, and the factors that lead to its quick, sad disintegration, may be the traditional center of the story, but along the way the plot jolts in so many wildly different directions that it's actually rendered secondary. Like a journey through the mind of a creative genius with serious ADD, it samples a dozen concepts strong enough to power their own film, then still finds a way to somehow marry them all into a single adventurous, mostly coherent, finale.

Everyone is getting ready to film and the actors are all present but the character played by Marcello Mastroianni doesn't have a story much less a script.  He confronts his wife, his girlfriends, friends and others who are hanging on his every whim and desire for employment and success.  Only with his leading actress, Claudia Cardinale can he let his guard down and allow her to be in the driver's seat (literally).  The others cling to him as he tries to run away and not be bothered in order to think.  The idea comes to him at the last moment before production has shut down and in the face of a staunch critic who tells him that he was right not to try rather than to risk failure.  The effort of creativity, fear of its loss and the vision others have of the artist which can be positive or toxic to artistic talent is a large theme in this movie.

Caul finds himself in the middle of a conspiracy after spying on a young couple (Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest). When he turns over the tapes (to a young Harrison Ford)he wonders what he's wandered into as it appears he may have put the couple in danger and someone may be following Harry himself.A low key paranoid thriller like The Parallax View, The Conversation features a marvelous, subtle performance by Gene Hackman (this is one of Hackman's favorite films and favorite performances)and strong work from the supporting cast (including Terri Garr and the late John Cazale).The transfer is quite nice with a surprising sharp transfer for a vintage film. Colors are subdued but that's the way the film has always looked. Keep in mind that the film is grainy and has always looked that way (it's not atypical for a film from the era).The audio sounds quite nice giving prominence to David Shire's moody score where appropriate. Dialogue is crystal clear throughout. we get both the mono and a nice 5.1 remix.The special features are quite nice for this set and surprisingly robust given that this isn't one of Coppola's best known films.We get everything ported over from the 2000 DVD including Coppola's commentary track as well as sound editor Walter Murch's commentary track. We also get the original vintage featurette on the film. The original theatrical trailer is also included as well.New to the Blu-ray are screen tests for both Cindy Williams and Harrison Ford. We also get a two minute excerpt from Coppola's film No Cigar which may have provided the inspiration for the this film.Harry Caul's San Francisco Then and Now compares the locations from 1973 to 2011. David Shire Interviewed by Francis Ford Coppola features composer (and Coppola's brother-in-law)discussing his score for the film. We also get a vintage interview with Hackman. We also get 50 minutes of audio dictation on the script for the film set to stills and film clips, etc.A combination of suspense thriller and character study The Conversation remains one of Coppola's best films. The film Enemy of State acts almost as an unoffical sequel to this film (it actually includes clips from The Conversation)in many respects (although a far less interesting film IMHO)so you may want to watch that as well.Recommended.\",\n",

We've seen the story before if not quite so heartless; think The Searchers if it were imagined by someone in a biker gang, only in this case, it's Opie (Ron Howard) at the reins.

The rest of the film explores how she achieves this through various adventures and misadventures in an incredibly endearing manner. Kiki is accompanied on said adventures by Jiji, her familiar in the form of a cynical black cat (voiced by Phil Hartman). Though the subject matter deals with witchcraft, it is the theme of adolescence and coming of age that permeates the story and appeals to viewers.

These are universal themes that many youngsters will relate to. Both my 7-year-old and I love this charming story.

You know it's coming the entire way through yet it happens with like five minutes left in the movie making little impact. Another big strike against it is that there is hardly any gore to speak of and what's there isn't particularly impressive. Considering that there's a praise blurb from Fangoria on the case, you'd expect a decent amount of nastiness but there's barely any. Then again, Fangoria lost any and all credibility they had years ago, so take that at what it's worth.Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer could've been much more than it winds up being, which is what's so disappointing. Trevor Matthews in the lead role is charismatic at times and gives his best effort but is hamstringed by the pitfalls of his character being underwritten. Robert Englund brings his A-game as usual but is ultimately wasted in his one note role. The best thing I can say is that there's a definite love for the genre here as many of the themes and scenes echo other entries in the genre, especially Jason Goes to Hell, Slither, Demons and of course, the Evil Dead. I'm going to give the filmmakers an A for effort because they really do try to make something worthwhile here but the end result is undercooked and the neglect resulting in this threadbare plot pretty much dooms this film to the bargain bin.

Sweet, funny and grounded, it's constantly flashing a dry wit and, although it often tugs at the heart strings, things never get overly soft or weepy. The trio of leads are diverse and interesting, each with an onion skin of personal history to explore, and their hunt for the child's parents amidst the overpopulation of a major world metropolis constantly jolts out in surprising new directions.

But those who know some of the playwright's background will be able to appreciate the symbolism captured in this movie based on the work Williams originally wrote as a one act play. It should also be noted that though Williams is given credit for writing the film with Gore Vidal, he was not happy with it and denounced it. It is indeed a metaphorically piece that probably translates better on stage. But classic movie lovers will still enjoy seeing Clift, Hepburn, and Taylor together in a maddening Southern Gothic black and white (thought the DVD cover is colorized) film from the 1950s.SLS is the story of Catharine Holly (Taylor), driven mad by the mysterious death of her cousin Sebastian while they were vacationing in Europe together. Her Aunt Violet (Hepburn) persuades neurosurgeon Dr. Cuckrowicz (Clift) to move Hepburn to his asylum to examine her, enticing him with financial backing in hopes of getting the doctor to perform a lobotomy on Catharine in order to conceal the truth about Sebastian. That truth is that he was a homosexual, but being the 1950s, The Hollywood Production Code made the film makers cut out all references to it. True, that leaves a bit of the plot line left up to interpretation, but also provides a wonderful mystery element to the film because everyone avoids the truth about Sebastian and his demise. But a truth serum given to Catharine reveals all in the end!Hepburn is brilliant as always, much deserving of the elevator-like throne she comes down out of the ceiling on in the movie. She's a classic eccentric here, giving the movie awesome nuances and she herself goes a bit mad in the end. The opening scene between her and Clift is the best! Young Taylor, mad throughout almost all of the film, is great too but still a bit too pretty most of the time. And Clift is a bit stiff, the irony being that he was hiding his own homosexuality.  Rumor has it that the directors treated him poorly and that Hepburn and Taylor both stood up for him.

This modern-day version is more rambunctious, more catered to the family SUV generation. I found myself liking it - for different reasons - just as much as I did the Clifton Webb/Myrna Loy production.Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt play the scrambling patriarch and matriarch of this chaotic brood. In raising twelve squabbling children, Tom (Martin) and Kate Baker (Hunt) have sacrificed much. And yet they still dream of having it all, of juggling the perfect family life with the successful careers. When Tom gets offered a job coaching college football at his prestigious alma mater and Kate's book takes off, they relocate the fam out of their rural home and into the bustling city, never mind that this puts the kids all out of sorts. In the 'burbs things seem okay on the surface, even though Tom is never home anymore, preoccupied as he is with the new job. But then Kate goes away on a whirlwind national book tour, leaving Tom in charge of the rowdy, feuding Baker clan. It's not too long before the pressures of a big time college program begin to undermine his parenting obligations. If Steve Martin's hair wasn't already white...CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN doesn't resonate as deeply as Martin's previous family pictures (FATHER OF THE BRIDE, PARENTHOOD). CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN does have its strong emotional beats, but mostly the story is played for hijinks. I'm fine with that. I thought this movie was fun. Familiar names are peppered in to offset the diverse cast of fresh kid faces. Steve Martin's career has evolved in that he has become a sort of iconic father figure in cinema. Bonnie Hunt, a fine, quick-witted comedienne, matches Martin in sharpness and timing. They have this easy rapport, and I believe them as a married couple. Piper Perabo plays the oldest sibling, Nora, who craves a life of her own but keeps getting dragged back into the crazy goings-on in the Baker household. Tom Welling is the discontented oldest son. Hilary Duff turns in a good performance as the even-keeled fashionista of the clan. Ashton Kutcher, back when he was up and coming, has a hilarious cameo as Perabo's self-involved model/actor. Poor Ashton Kutcher.But it's the kids, with their personal oddities, who lend a refreshing spikiness to the story. Alyson Stoner (who you may've seen in those Missy Elliot music videos) is the standout as the tomboy ringleader Sarah, mastermind of some of the most diabolical pranks ever put to film (the meat-soaking prank is quite excellent). But it's young Forrest Landis who plays the shy, neglected Mark - nicknamed FedEx by his siblings because they claim he was dropped off at the house as a baby - whose actions provide salvation for the quickly deteriorating Baker household. But, wait, before the expected happy ending, the Bakers fall into one wild crisis after crisis, whether it's a pet frog sabotaging breakfast, tag-team throw-up, a recurring gag involving an unstable chandelier, or the wanton destruction of a neighbor's sedate birthday bash. Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy, that mild-mannered couple, would've applied the cane by now. Back in the day, parents really put their kids on punishment.Stick around for the bloopers at the end of the movie.This movie comes in two formats: widescreen on one side, full screen on the other.

Ben Affleck plays a good enough Matt Murdock and his costume looks better than the ones in the old comic books. The fight scene at the bar needed some editing but most of the other scenes were somewhat good to very good. Garner delivers an average performance as Elektra. One of the problems with this film is that there were several logic holes. See spoilers at the very end if you want to read about some of them. Good choice with darkness and lights.

Small appearance by Ellen Pompeo, as the secretary of Murdock and Froggy's firm, who would later star in Grey's Anatomy. The Razzies nominated Affleck for worst actor but the nomination was unjustified. The budget for this film was $79M and made just a tad under $180M at the Box Office. Even though it did well there were a number of attempts to continue with the franchise but too many obstacles have yet to produce Daredevil 2. All said, a refresh to Daredevil is in the works and that's the main reason I watched this film again.

              "       \"The latest True Grit is a worthy film, possibly even a great one. But it's time for a closer assessment of the film as well as the common practice of movie remakes, which are popular with movie producers primarily because of a guaranteed box office draw.  In taking on the remake of True Grit the Coen Brothers might be expected to adhere, albeit it with creative flare, to the original story.  A radical make-over would seem especially ill-suited to this film for a number of reasons. Perhaps above all, its Dukish screen icon and Rhinestone Cowboy co-star, Glen Campbell, are sufficiently ensconced in public memory to make a barely recognizable True Grit seem disrespectful if not offensive.  Doing a remake of True Grit that is more a display of originality than a sincere adaptation would strike critics and public alike as intellectually and artistically dishonest.At the same time, if the goal was faithful adherence to the original, there are far safer bets than the Coen Brothers.  The history of these filmmakers includes the off-beat black comedy Fargo and, more recently, That Is No Country for Old Men, a film closer to the existential, thought-provoking cinema of Ingmar Bergman than to conventional Hollywood entertainment.  Moreover, the original True Grit had certain elements that by today's standards might be considered sentimental, formulaic, or Disney-esque--i.e. dated, out-of-step with a new millennium along with its impatient and jaded consumers in a post-modern, digitalized mediascape.  Among today's directors the Coen Brothers, moreover, have established the expectation of making films that are off-beat, unconventional, utterly unique.  As a result, I was prepared for a wholesale remodeling, a barely recognizable approximation, of the original movie, which attained semi-classic stature primarily because it was Duke's last hurrah.So what approach did the Coen Brothers take?  Remarkably, they elected NOT to play a clever, strikingly original hand with a test-proven, practically archetypal, property such as the one given them.  Viewers can pick up either of the two True Grits without fear of being misled into distortions of the literary source.  The viewer can just as readily watch both True Grits in succession and come out the wiser about the challenges facing the makers of remakes of popular films.To begin with, it's critical to take note of how the Coens' script has pointed the viewer to the literary source, using the point of view (POV) of the daughter (Mattie), who is determined to avenge the killing of her father.  Moreover, the Coens have, to a degree considerably greater than the original, lifted  language directly from the literary source, even to the point of testing the credulity of a modern-day audience that is at once more deficient in language skills and ever more convinced that theirs is the exceptionally gifted child.  Those who marvel at the scenery and score of the remake may forget too easily that the original version directed by Henry Hathaway was almost as mindful of its Western spaces (though neither version so completely captures the nature surrounding the quest for revenge as John Ford's The Searchers) and of the importance of expanding the uncharted territory with a full-blown symphonic orchestration.  But the primary differences to story and plot, or to script, apart from the aforementioned are in a more graphic and shocking attention to detail, thanks to the use of more shock edits as well as a more dynamic, intrusive (at times jolting) sound-track.  The effect is to make the world of the hunted and the hunter as much a  part of the spectator's world as the wastelands of That Is No Country for Old Men or the frozen tundra of Fargo.  There is no escaping the world of nature, however merciless, cold-blooded, and life-threatening it can be to all of us who, as mortal beings, necessarily share in its destiny.Apart from the absence of John Wayne, the most obvious difference in characterization for many spectators is likely to be in the character of Mattie.  In the original version Kim Darby's Mattie is determined but at the same time a trifle awkward, or boyish, rather than precocious; she was a transplant from a Disney film about a tomboyish young girl intent upon showing her meddle.  In the remake Mattie is none of these things: rather, Halle Steinfeld's Mattie is a precocious, extraordinary articulate and intelligent 14-year-old feminist!  The question of her age and even gender are beside the point from the opening scene.  Her command of jurisprudence jargon and latin, her unhalting and complex verbal syntax, her keen intelligence and control of language are so complete and advanced as to tax the viewer's credulity (in fact, our suspension of disbelief is saved only by the reminder that that what we're witnessing is the account through the experienced perspective of the adult Mattie).Matt Damon's LaBoeuf is quite obviously a more experienced screen actor than the role as played by country and western popular music star Glenn Campbell.  At the same time, Campbell's bumbling ways may seem more appropriate to the tenderfoot status that he occupies in the original film, in which he attains some redeeming maturity just prior to his death.  In the remake, Matt Damon's La Boeuf is able to provide a more capable and credible foil to Jeff Bridges' crustiness.  His strength might be seen as another device employed by the Coens to replace the original's most irreplaceable element, i.e., John Wayne.  For the same reason, the remake counterbalances Rooster Cogburn with a more formidable and believable antagonist.  Tom Chaney in the original is little more than a faceless, soon-forgotten villain, completely overwhelmed by the John Wayne protagonist that occupies our attention during and long after the movie.  The role as played by Josh Brolin's bad guy in the remake is one we take more seriously, especially given our familiarity with the actor in films like That Is No Country.  The emphasis he receives is yet another answer to the overwhelming, indomitable presence of Wayne's Rooster Cogburn in the original.The signature of a genuine auteur, as Andre Bazin and his followers argued, is not a film director who has complete control of his project along with the liberties of expressing himself as he chooses.  Alfred Hitchock was the most admired director of the influential French film theorists because he left his personal stamp on each of his films in spite of the commercial, profit-making priority expected of him in each instance.  There's a trademark tone, a consistency, a thematic purpose, or worldview, that becomes apparent in every Hitchcock film, even to a viewer who at the outset is unfamiliar with the director.And here's where the Coen brothers have excelled.  Rather than taking a radically different, bold or quirky approach, they've stayed within the rules and, in spite of long odds, achieved a cinematic triumph that is consonant with the themes of their less formulaic films.  In the beginning of the film the stakes are made clear by the voiceover. As mortal beings we are accountable for our past actions, each of which will have consequences from which we can't hide.  In the end there is no concealing our offenses against society, nature or God; there is no escape or freedom; mortality in itself is at once inescapable, beautiful, and deadly.  Despite our wishes to the contrary, as Tommy Lee Jones' sheriff reminds us at the end of That Is No Country, there is no ultimate justice, no deus ex machine that will, at some climactic moment in our lives, rescue us from the final encounter against which, as Dylan Thomas reminds us, all mortals have no more than two options: 1. wearing blinders and cowering in fear; or 2. singing in our chains while raging against the dying of the light.In the original True Grit, spectators had, prior to attending the film or shortly afterward, knowledge that the film was elegy as much as saga. Wayne's mythic character would not spare him from the cancer he was already fighting. It was in fact our knowledge of that human flaw that made the title True Grit stand not simply for the exceptional man but the universal one. Much as we hate to admit it, all of us in search of a dramatic rescue or, seeking escapist entertainment in movies, must confront the fact of our mortal existence. Better it be with eyes open and a healthy appreciation of life's bounties than the whimper of a cowardly lion. For some, there may be the consolations offered by religion, but neither the original story nor the Coen brothers' movie goes there. The church, to the extent that it is even visible in a Coen Brothers' movie, is presented as ineffectual, deluded and hypocritical.In place of salvation lying outside the camera lens is an unflinching representation of the only life that the camera along with human consciousness can know. If it's not enough, it's more than most filmmakers have been able to offer. The Coen Brothers reveal what will be required of each of us at the conclusion of life's journey: the truest grit of all.\",\n",
              "       \"He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities, and by his wounds we are healed...The words from Isaiah, written 700 years before the crucifixion, are the only introduction to this remarkable film. On a moonlit night the clouds part and bathe a figure crying out in a garden, his soul wracked with torment, in white light. The man is the Messiah, Jesus, who only days before was welcomed into Jerusalem as a holy man and king. His disciples are asleep nearby, despite his pleadings for them to stay awake and pray with him. From the shadows a figure observes, mesmerizing but evil to the very marrow of his soul. The shadow is Satan and deception and selfishness are his tools as he urges the Christ to give up this road, to let mankind atone for their own sins. But Jesus refuses to submit to the seductive lies of the deceiver and symbolically crushes Satan's pet serpent under his heel.In the Jewish Temple Judas stands before the High Priests. He has been promised thirty pieces of silver for betraying the Christ. The coins scatter around him on the floor and he hastily bends to pick them up. Torches illuminate the night as he leads them to the Gardens to arrest the Messiah. The disciples resist but Jesus comes willingly into the Temple Court. At the moment of his arrest Mary, his mother, awakens in torment, certain something terrible is happening. John has managed to escape and comes to fetch her and Mary Magdalene. They are not allowed inside the counsel but there Jesus is questioned, slandered, spit on, and sent to the Romans in order to plead for his execution. Pontius Pilate's wife Claudia has awoken from a nightmare and begs him not to sentence the king of the Jews to death. But Jesus has been sent to earth to bear the burden of sin for mankind. The penalty is persecution, merciless beating, and eventual crucifixion.One of the most emotionally disturbing but profoundly touching films to come out in a long time, The Passion of the Christ has arisen great controversy, and for good reason. Between the themes and the brutality, there is a lot not to like... and a lot to appreciate both as a believer, and as a scholar of history. This film is visually stunning to the point of being overwhelming. Its subject matter is extremely dark but mesmerizing. The slow arch of the bag of coins as it flies through the air into Judas' outstretched hand... a close up of Mary Magdalene as Jesus cries It is finished... the tears on her face, the wind slowly caressing her hair... the captivating but disturbing image of Satan watching Jesus flogged nearly to death with great pleasure, holding a child-like demon in his arms. These characters are real. You empathize with the good and hate the bad. For an instant when he first appears you're mesmerized by Satan, wondering if the apparition is an angel... but then you realize the truth. The malice in its eyes, the cold deception of its words. Jesus is someone you instinctively love. You pity Him, feel each of the blows... flashbacks illuminate moments of His extraordinary life. The acting is so good you don't even think about the actors... it's too real. I loved the enhancement on James Caviezel's eyes... they are absolutely spellbinding, full of love throughout torment.Catholics will appreciate the symbolism rampant throughout, as well as nods to traditional Catholic teachings and the writing of Josephus. There are mild deviations from scripture and a few of the writers' additions are unexplained, but the film is one we should all see at least once. If you're a Christian, you need to understand The Sacrifice, and if you're not... you need to understand what we believe.\",\n",

Harrowing stills and snippets of film from the height of the genocide are interspersed with long, lingering shots of the cracked, overgrown concrete shells left behind, while a stirring narration pulls the audience into the victims' shoes. It's terribly difficult material, but the sensitive, carefully written voice-over frames things in a way that's honest and factual without feeling aggressive or exploitative. That French vocal track moves quickly, so I had trouble keeping up with the subtitles on a few occasions, but considering the breadth of observations it crams into a very short running time, I think that's forgivable. Extremely dark, heavy, emotional stuff that shouldn't be forgotten, my only qualm is with the absurdly cheery, generic stock music that fleshes out the background in a few scenes.\",\n",

Originally intended as one-third of a short story anthology, the studio called an audible midway through production and stretched it to a feature length by itself. The lack of preparation is crippling, as bad effects, terrible scenery, atrocious dialog and a heavily padded plot are exposed and emphasized by the longer running time. Sinise's character, the intended heart and soul of the picture, is incendiary and unlikeable, a standoffish prick who makes an already-bad position worse for himself in almost every situation. The awful lines he spits (seriously, the worst-written dialog this side of The Room) aren't helped by a hyperactive editor, switching angles several times in a single sentence. Awful in almost every sense, at least it goes out with a bang.\",\n",
              "       \"At the end, the whole premise of Running Scared (2007) may crumble into a pile of too convenient fluff, but along the way the movie does take you on an unpredictable roller coaster ride, with some wild gut wrenching turns and unexpected thrills.  The pulsating crime adventure takes place mostly during one long crazy night, and features an array of interesting characters, set in some unusual circumstances, where violence frequently erupts.Joey Gazelle (Paul Walker) is part of the Perello family, an organized crime gang who are surprised during a drug deal, by three masked men with guns, who attempt to rob them.  After a violent shootout, one of the robbers escapes, and it is discovered that the two dead robbers were cops.  Joey's boss Tommy Perello (Johnny Messner) gathers some handguns, and instructs Joey to dispose of the evidence.Gazelle returns to his home in the suburbs, and is observed by his son Nicky (Alex Neuberger), and his friend Oleg (Cameron Bright), hiding the guns in his basement.  While the family is eating dinner, shots ring out, and a bullet narrowly misses Joey's head.  He heads next door and discovers that his neighbor Anzor Yugorsky (Karel Roden) has been shot by his stepson Oleg, who has vanished with a distinctive chrome handgun that Gazelle recognizes as his boss's piece.Joey realizes that if he doesn't recover Perello's gun, he is a dead man, and his quest to find Oleg and recover the gun, is a frantic and suspenseful adventure that eventually involves his son Nicky, and his wife Teresa (Vera Farminga).  Facing various crises, their activities generate ripples that eventually come crashing back.  Matters are further complicated by the actions of Rydell (Chazz Palminteri) the crooked cop who escaped the initial robbery attempt, and Russian mob boss Ivan Yugorski (John Noble), who is working a deal with the Perello family.The storyline is unpredictable, often electric with tension, and takes place at locations spread across the state of New York, during one very eventful night.  The characters generally seem real, and the acting mostly believable, with some very strong performances all around, particularly Cameron Bright, Vera Farminga, and Paul Walker.  The chances are that most will be drawn into the movie, and develop strong feelings about the main characters, as lots of crazy things happen along the way.Running Scared just keeps the hits coming, but near the end, things do go start to go too far.  There is an extremely overdramatic scene set in a hockey rink, where both profanity and violence explode.  Taking several hockey puck hits to the head, Joey should have his face broken, and be minus at least one eye, but he somehow manages to survive a vicious shootout.  Just when you think you can relax, another crisis occurs, as the missing gun unexpectedly turns up.  This is followed by an explosive fatality, and even more drama as Gazelle races to get home before he bleeds out.The film's twist ending, is a huge disappointment, featuring a development that obliterates the credibility of most of what occurred up to that point.  After jerking the rug out from underneath, the movie sells out completely, never really offering an explanation for what is an absurd situation, one where the circumstances apparently absolves all those involved of any guilt for their crimes, including murder.After the great things that preceded it, the storybook finish provides grounds to question the judgment of big studios.  It you are going to make a gritty, violent, brutal, stylish thriller, have the balls to see it through to a fitting end, and not cop out like some sappy TV movie.  Running Scared is definitely worth seeing, but the title seems to apply more to the filmmakers, than the characters in the movie.\",\n",

Stiller, Jack Black and a blackface-wearing Robert Downey Jr. share the center of the stage as hopelessly detached superstar actors who are unceremoniously dumped into the bush but still believe they're on the set. Each gets their homerun lines and the primary story is lots of fun, but the real stars are the unchained phony movie trailers, advertisements and celebrity cameos that speckle the picture. Tom Cruise in particular is a major scene stealer as the hairy, chunky, balding movie exec with no filter - every single one of his all-too-brief appearances left me aching with laughter and yearning for more. Who knew he had such an intensely funny side? It's among the rare breed of comedies that never stops being hilarious, even for a little while, and one of the most unabashedly funny films I've seen in a long time.\",\n",

Warren William plays Caesar as De Mille himself, Henry Wilcoxen plays Anthony as an oaf and Claudette Colbert takes centerstage as the kind of vixen who knows which side of the Roman Empire her bread is buttered. At times De Mille's tongue is firmly in his cheek - not least a wonderfully drawn out death scene from Leonard Mudie that wouldn't look out of place in Carry On Cleo or Cleo's spectacular seduction of Tony on that fabled barge - but there's some fine filmmaking here too, not least a great battle montage padded out with footage from the silent Ten Commandments and a fine bit of censor baiting as a foreground hand ostensibly playing the harp seems to almost paw at Colbert's body. It ain't history but it is fun. Nice score from Rudolph Kopp too.It's worth seeking out the special edition release which, while not overloaded with extra features, does offer a bit more than other editions: audio commentary by F.X. Feeney, featurettes Claudette Colbert - Queen of the Silver Screen, Cecil B. de Mille - Hollywood's Epic Director and Forbidden Film - The Production Code Era (the latter also available onPre-Code Hollywood Collection (The Cheat / Merrily We Go to Hell / Hot Saturday / Torch Singer / Murder at the Vanities / Search for Beauty) (Universal Backlot Series)), reissue trailer introduced with typical flamboyance by De Mille, and three artcards.\",\n",
              "       \"This may be the most literal film adaptation of a print property we'll ever see, but that alone can't make it half as successful as it could have been. Having grown up with the trade paperback by my bedside, a holy grail of sorts for comic book fanatics, it's almost a religious experience to see these themes, characters and visuals represented so loyally on the big screen. As he did with 300, Zac Snyder has absolutely nailed the look and feel of the comics, breathtakingly, but underneath that dazzling surface is a terrible lack of soul, conviction and character. With the exception of Jackie Earl Haley, who is absolutely magnificent as the mentally teetering vigilante Rorschach, this is a large collection of miscast characters which never really seem to buy into what they're saying or doing. The words are right, ripped line-for-line from the bubbles and narrative boxes of the comics, and of course everyone looks great, but bland inflections, bad interpretations and a hectic, compressed timeframe strip away the power of the plot's weightiest moments. In a way it's TOO loyal, as it's surprisingly the one major moment that steps away from the guiding hands of the source material - a significant tweak to the story's conclusion - that works the best. Snyder was ambitious to tackle such a booby-trapped property, and to do so with such a passionate love for its roots is admirable, but there's a reason it was dubbed unfilmable for so many years. There's so much going on at any given moment that even the most familiar reader runs the risk of being bucked, and even at three hours, a large portion of the story is left on the cutting room floor. And for Watchmen, those seemingly-dispensible character moments are every bit as important as the heaviest plot developments. A valiant effort, but ultimately a failed one.\",\n",
              "       \"Being There is a lovingly-crafted, slightly overlong and knee-slappingly funny political satire which includes one of the most bizarre 'sex' scenes in movie history. Peter Sellers is a riot as the deadpan Chance Gardener whose endless pontificating on the welfare of plant-life becomes a potent metaphor for 80's politics, granting him national attention thanks to the endorsement of a dying codger and his concupiscent wife. The film is timeless, save one walking montage early on that seems like it was scored by a malfunctioning machine. The action is primarily contained to a cold, ornate mansion, though it does not seem catastrophic, instead casting a wide sense of exposure due to the fact that most plot points revolve around television and its ability to manipulate the truth--if the truth ever even existed to begin with! Much has been made of the film's final shot with its Christ-like implications. For me, the last few frames make the movie--elevating the proceedings to a level not quite broached by all the network-TV nudging and winking when Chance says things like All Is Well In The Garden a phrase you might find yourself constantly regurgitating long after the credits have rolled. If you don't mind a slow-boiling storyline and are excited by good old fashioned acting, you will find much to love here. And oh, stick around for a blooper reel (one of the first of its kind) which shows Sellers with his hair down, worth the price of admission alone.\",\n",
              "       \"Mike Nichols' adaptation of Edward Albee's award-winning, deeply polarizing play begins rather slowly, but don't expect it to remain in stasis. In fact, the opening sequence of the two elderly academics trundling home from a faculty party is deceptively easy and almost loving. There is yet no indication that the following events will contain some of the most pointed, venomous verbal attacks ever committed to celluloid. The movie is darkly hilarious as it gathers momentum. Two couples, locked in a room, digging at one another with drunken fervor. George and Martha are old-school heavyweights. Martha's father maintains a high post in the university in which George is employed, much to everyone's chagrin. George is, in Martha's eyes, and perhaps his own, a flaccid little failure. He amounts to little more than a BOG in the History Department. The new meat on the chopping block, as it were, arrive in the form of Nick and Honey: the former occupying a seat in the Biology department--a topic of great interest for George. After a few drinks are poured (okay, more than a few), the film bolts forth into a series of increasingly alienating and uncomfortable psychological mind games--some of which turn physical. Do not let the B&W disarm you, this is a bitter, barbed-wire wit film that makes recent cranky couple pictures like Polanski's Carnage look decidedly calm by comparison. Albee and Nichols have a dream cast to work with, particularly Taylor and Burton, who turn in performances the likes of which are rarely scene in conventional cinema. They are razor-sharp, dirty, scaldingly cruel. The mastery of the film is that there are few moments when one wishes to actually leave their company. In less capable hands, most audience members would be out the door after the first Act, when things really start to turn ugly. Don't leave early or you'll miss the inevitable game of hump the hostess (one of the words which drew so much controversy upon the film's initial release (though curiously in the updated version of the play for the '00s the only words Albee really added are F-words, but I digress)). In short, the film rockets through the minutia and the madness of marital train wreckage. And it never does apologize.\",\n",
              "       \"So much has been written about the film.  So much has been said.  So much has been debated, discussed, dissected, and so much has been praised or insulted or misunderstood.  Those of us who celebrate film will always owe a special debt to the people at Anchor Bay: for the first time since it was released, BATTLE ROYALE is now being made available - uncensored, uncut, unrated - in America.No doubt that BATTLE ROYALE's Blu-ray release was intended to coincide with the launch of another  book-turned-film-franchise, THE HUNGER GAMES, in theatres in March, 2012.  Clearly, that's some savvy marketing, as people from around the world have been arguing about the comparisons since the books by Suzanna Collins appeared.  To her credit, Ms. Collins claims that she'd never heard of BATTLE ROYALE, nor read the 1999 Japanese novel of the same name that the movie was based on.  I'll take her at her word, and I'll leave that debate to folks who've schooled themselves in those facts.In the not-too-distant-future, Japan's economy has collapsed.  As a result, unemployment is destroying the culture.  Crime is on the rise.  Hoping to keep its next generation under its control, the Japanese government passed The BR (`Battle Royale') Law, which requires one 9th grade class each year to be shipped off to an island.  Their mission?  Kill each other until only one person is left.  There are some other fine points to the game (i.e. each student is given a duffle full of supplies, the Island is broken into danger zones, etc.), but the message remains the same: 42 kids enter, 1 may leave.That simple concept practically explodes into one of the bloodiest, shocking flicks captured on film!As I said above, much has been written about ROYALE's violence, so much so that I'll take a pass on that topic.  Violence is violence - there isn't any escaping it - and, when buckets of blood rules at the box office, the film certainly delivers.  What fascinated me much more about this story is the way that the 42 students of the film created their own subcultures once they've been deposited on the island.  Some of them remain fiercely independent, while others are doggedly loyal to one another.  Some of them panic as a result of the circumstances, and they immediately turn on one another.  What's fascinating is that who they become as a result of the situation thrust upon them in many ways resembles an extension of who they were before it all when to heck in a handbasket.  The manipulative `losers' become even more manipulative in order to survive the game, just as the computer nerds quickly go to work on cracking the hard science behind their entrapment.  If anything, ROYALE shows - despite its joyous subversiveness - that who a person is at his core will inevitably dictate what he'll become when a new society comes calling.  Agree with it or not, that's a powerful message, and it clearly shows why ROYALE deserves much more study in the years ahead.  Now that it's available legitimately in the U.S., it'll hopefully gain an even greater following.As stated, this is a fully uncut restoration, and it's been given a first class treatment here.  While the disc boasts absolutely zero special features, I'm so appreciative of having a clean cut available to me that I don't believe I missed much.  The picture is fabulous (mostly), but there are a few scenes which clearly were either shot poorly `in the can' or were tinkered with in post-production (zoom ins), a choice that ultimately limited the quality.  You'll see instantly what I mean: three or four short cuts are covered in grain.  Sound is excellent - a noticeable improvement over the previous foreign DVD release I've had in my collection for a few years - which is nice because the film makes great use of some background audio and even a limited score.  Now all we need is a massive Intellectual Edition release which scores and scores and scores of commentaries, essays, features, and interviews about the picture.Maybe I'm overdoing it, and, if you think so, you'll have to pardon my excitement.  Those of us who've loved ROYALE privately for years are ecstatic to be treated to a terrific stateside release.  Yes, the film's dark.  Of course, it's a textbook example of subversive cinema at its finest.  It'll make you think, squeal, squirm.  Shock.  Joy.  Revenge.  And cookies.  Everything you could want in a picture is in here - somewhere - so, if you've never seen it, I encourage you to do it today.  Put the kids to bed.  Pop some fresh popcorn.  Dim the lights.  Prepare yourself for the darkest of dark tragedies - this modern day epic - and let the chips fall where they may.  Blood will be shed.  Oh, yes, it will.HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  Yes, BATTLE ROYALE is an instant classic.  While the subject matter or elements of the presentation may disturb you, keep in mind that there will probably never be another film like it in your lifetime.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Anchor Bay provided me with a DVD screener copy for the expressed purposes of completing this review.\",\n",

Literally every single shot dips liberally from the well of overuse, culminating in an early car chase with a little old lady, a roving gang of bicyclists and a dozen diving pedestrians in the road, no less than five instantly-combustible parked cars and a Lamborghini that leaps through a plate glass window. Nic Cage and Sean Connery, no strangers to this type of picture, freely toss away their inhibitions and embrace the cheese from word one and, along with a straight-laced performance from Ed Harris, somehow validate the whole thing. The dialog would have been deemed too unrealistic for a Hanna-Barbara cartoon, but through sheer force of will (plus a few blatant winks at the audience) it works too.

People did not talk this way in this country, ever at any time. Never mind. This is a fun pic. Jeff Bridges is great at reprising John Wayne's last big role. The only hitch is his choice of dialect, which makes much of what he growls almost inaudible. I turned on the subtitles to solve that problem. He clearly stole his voice and tone from the Karl character in the movie Sling Blade. Down to a Tee. The young girl who dominates the picture does fine with her character, too. The Texas Ranger of Matt Damon is the weakest link, and Josh Brolin has almost nothing to do as the killer they are all trying to catch in Indian country.

Like a cinematic Wanderlei Silva, this is an action picture that just does not stop throwing haymakers until it's finished, and I love it for that simple-minded dedication to its own nature. Uma Thurman is surprisingly well suited for the role of the double-crossed professional killer on a blood vendetta, as she rampages from one gory smackdown to the next without lifting her icy mask for more than a wink and a nod. The plot is simple enough, with Thurman literally carrying a list of the five heads she's out to collect with her from scene to scene, but doubles down on thick atmosphere and detailed dossiers on every major player. Though it's sliced in half with all the abruptness of a katana slash, the story's split doesn't bother me a bit; in a way it's an appropriate intermission, as the two very different halves are able to stand on their own without getting in each other's way.

Jack Nicholson is empathetic as Warren Schmidt, a disenchanted recent-retiree whose daughter is marrying a daft pony-tailed mama's boy and whose whose sole enjoyment seems to be had imparting wisdom (and sharing more than few rants) with a small boy in Africa. Nicholson's narration of letters he composes and presumably sends across the sea is perfect, comic and depressing in equal measure. The film teeters at times between slow meandering and genius scenes. Nicholson spends a bit too much time at Kathy Bates' house late in the film, for instance, and a little too much time preparing to go on the road. The first and third act of the film are enormously entertaining, particularly an early montage (signaling the first, and most detailed letter to Nicholson's pen-pal/surrogate son). Though it occasionally feels plodding and detached, About Schmidt manages to balance its pallor with spot-on examinations of married life, family life, and getting up and over the hill. Alexander Payne proves that he can push through spells of disillusionment, locating beautiful truths lurking amid all the grey thoughts and surface tension.\",\n",

I can't tell you how many films from this specific time period fall under this category.  As a result, these movies *look* impressive but seriously lack substance and feel incomplete from a writing perspective more often than not.Anyway, the only reason I'm not giving the Hole a 1 or 2-star rating is because there is actually a pretty good twist at the end that I didn't see coming judging by the mediocre first hour or so.  The plot is based around a group of teens who, as a joke, asked to be locked inside of an underground bunker, and then after a certain amount of time their friend will come back with they key to unlock them.  For a while the teens are having fun in the bunker getting drunk, stoned and just partying nonstop, however it's soon realized that their friend isn't coming back.Now I WILL give the movie writers credit for one thing- they did a pretty good job with the twist at the end.  Not the most remarkable job in the world, but given the shallow storyline, yeah, it's a surprising turn of events that won me over.  Spoiling the twist would ruin the entire script so... hush hush!  Don't spoil it!Other than focusing on the final 20 minutes of film and that splendid twist, the rest of the writing failed to deliver in the suspense department, which -given the potential for a mighty good movie upon reading the description- is disappointing.  I mean come on- teens are trapped underground and hours turn into days and they're *still* trapped.  They should have been so tense and angry and... I suppose they were to an extent, but the events really don't develop the way I was expecting, and that's not a compliment.  Too much filler pertaining to an overabundance of lackluster and overdramatic segments that accomplish very little.  You know, typical teenager nonsense that's only interesting to people of that age group.Plus the one girl was ALWAYS loud.  The one attractive enough to qualify as a supermodel.  She was always screaming and exaggerating like she expected the world to hand her anything she wants.  Ugh!  The rest of the actors and actresses were good, especially the main character (the other girl).  The lack of suspense and quality writing prevents this film from winning me over.Overall, not a bad film by any means, but definitely not the suspense I was hoping for.\",\n",
              "       \"Anchored by a top rate performance by Robert Downey Jr., this  exciting, well directed take on Iron Man will go down as one of the best comic book movies out this generation.  The respect and love of the filmmakers for the material is evident throughout the film.  Marvel studios could not have chosen a better film to be their first independently financed and produced movie.  The movie set the bar high for all the Marvel films that came after (and it is debatable whether or not any film, including the sequel to Iron Man, ever reached that bar again).The 2 Disc Blu-Ray Ultimate Edition is fantastic. On the first disc you get a 47 minute documentary that explores the Iron Man comic book, from its origins to the current story lines he is involved in (at least at the time of the film's original release).  The writers and artists who have worked on Iron Man over the years take part in the documentary, discussing what changes they made to the character and why.  As someone who didn't really follow the Iron Man comic book, I found the documentary to be fascinating.  Also on the first disc is a collection of deleted/extended scenes, running for a total of 24 minutes.  Most of these are superfluous additions, bits of dialogue or action scenes that don't add anything to the story and were almost certainly taken out for pacing reasons.  There is a feature that focuses on the 4 different suits in the movie.  You can view each suit from any angle, checking out the function/feature of each piece.  I like the concept, but it takes to long to load each section.  What we're missing on this disc is something I really wanted...a director's commentary and/or a cast commentary.The 2nd disc is devoted to the making of the movie itself.  The highlight is a 7 part documentary that runs almost 2 hours.  It covers all aspects of the production, from initial designs, through shooting, and into the editing and special effects.  It was filmed concurrently with the production, so you get a mixture of on the set interviews and interviews done later looking back at the production.  As a whole, it is a well done documentary.  It isn't a classic like Heart of Darkness (which covers the filming of Apocalypse Now) or The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of Twelve Monkeys (which covers 12 Monkeys), but it isn't a pure fluff piece.  I highly recommend watching this.  The 2nd disc also contains a 27 minute featurette on the special effects and Robert Downey Jr.'s screen test,In the end, the movie is the star here, but this is a very well done special edition.  If/when they re-release the blu-ray (probably around the release of Iron Man 3), I don't know what else they could add to make it a better edition, except for a commentary track or two.\",\n",

It's dumb in an earnest and appealing way, with Sandler in his element as the dense, innocent hayseed with tons of peculiar charisma and an aggressively violent streak. He's undeniably the centerpiece of this story, but also isn't afraid to share the screen with the other denizens of this obtuse little world he's populated - a necessity, since a crippling stutter leaves him unable to complete more than a few sentences at a time. Kathy Bates and Henry Winkler unleash their wickedly funny hidden talents in supporting roles as Sandler's sanctimonious, over-protective mother and cowardly savant football coach, respectively. Though the SNL alum would later dip into the well too often, at this point his backup squad of one-note bit characters and bizarre non sequiturs still felt fresh and genuine. Loaded with buried gems and unexpectedly brilliant one-liners, it left me grinning and wiping tears from my eyes in several spots. Much funnier than the absurdly simple concept would lead you to believe.\",\n",
              "       \"The physical violence in Roman Polanski's THE NINTH GATGE is so campy and melodramatic it reminds me of. . .Hitchcock.  Polanski is far too superb a filmmaker to half bake the scuffles and fisticuffs unintentionally; to me, it looks to be a throwback to the melodramatic silliness that Hitchcock presented in his films of half a century ago.  I kept waiting for flocks of birds to descend and add to the mayhem confronting our protagonist, but I digress.  THE NINTH GATE is a quirky mixture of suspense, thrills, and a tongue-in-cheek nod to the occult; with Johnny Depp in the lead playing a bewildered and harassed book collector realizing his current gig to authenticate a rare book is approaching the metaphysical realm, this is one fun ride.Three copies of a very rare, very old, book--a book allegedly co-written by the Dark Lord himself; book detective Dean Corso (Depp) is hired by an eccentric millionaire (a cheeky Frank Langella) to compare his copy to the other two copies in Europe.  Problem is, people start dying as Corso conducts his investigation--and Corso himself constantly faces deadly peril, only to be saved, again and again, by a nameless femme fatale in need of some shampoo (Emmanuelle Seigner).  Corso is stalked, hounded, assaulted, pursued, and then the copy he's been carrying is stolen.  Corso and his companion in turn pursue the thieves, only to find themselves in a country lair with some serious Beezlebub revelers.  Corso's malevolent employer himself appears at the festivities, retrieves the book, and the true deal with the Devil takes place.  The meaning of THE NINTH GATE is revealed, with Corso experiencing a very close encounter with the dark side.  Depp is eccentric, quirky, dazed, and confused; THE NINTH GATE is a satisfying suspense tale, with a possible tribute to the keystone cops physicality of a bygone era.--D. Mikels, Esq.\",\n",

Excluding an explosive, high-powered gunfight and a dramatic, suspenseful standoff of a finale, Heat is almost entirely interested in playing up tension and exploring character motivations. Its powerful cast is astoundingly well-rounded, with a complete lack of black-and-white personalities. Villains show their soft sides, heroes bare their dark underbellies, and in-betweeners continue to straddle the chasm between fates. Devoting the vast majority of its running time to the careful, calculated dance between law-saddled feds and their spooked targets, it applies the same flirty mentality to the inevitable rendezvous between the two big-name stars. It's a film that constantly teases its viewers with promises, only to yank them out of sight at the very last moment and resume playing hide-and-seek. That persistent devotion to delaying the shrapnel in favor of more character-building does result in a tremendous ensemble of players, and ultimately we care about the fate of every one of them. It also causes an already-long three hour duration to feel more like five or six.\",\n",
              "       \"12 Angry Men, the classic Sidney Lumet film that featured one of the most riveting, thought-provoking courtroom dramas in cinema history.But before the 1957 film was made, writer Reginald Rose would create a teleplay of 12 Angry Men for Westinghouse Studio One, a CBS live production that aired back in Sept. 20, 1954.This was during a time when people were buying television to move away from radio programming to teleplays featured on both CBS and NBC and the response that the teleplay received was tremendous and would go on to win three Emmy Awards for Rose, director Franklin Schaffner and Robert Cummings for Best Actor.  Suffice to say, the teleplay's success would lead to a play adaptation in 1955.With the success of the teleplay, actor Henry Fonda wanted to bring 12 Angry Men to the big screen and working with Reginald Rose, the two decided to go for it.  The only challenge was to keep things within the budget of $350,000 and so that meant finding a director that was talented but not expensive.  And so, they went with a television director named Sidney Lumet (who would go on to direct Network, Dog Day Afternoon, Before the Devil Knows Your Dead), who never directed a film before, but had the experience to make this teleplay work on film.With the film primarily using one set, the film dependent on the actors.  And while Henry Fonda (The Grapes of Wrath, Once Upon a Time in the West, On Golden Pond) was the lead actor and the best known actor of the film, 12 Angry Men would also star Joseph Sweeney and George Voskovec (both who were featured in the Westinghouse Studio One teleplay) and star Ed Begley (The Unsinkable Molly Brown, Hang `Em High), the film debut of Jack Klugman (The Odd Couple, Quincy, Days of Wine and Roses), Jack Warden (Shampoo, Heaven Can Wait), Martin Balsam (Psycho, Breakfast at Tiffany's, Tora! Tora! Tora!), John Fiedler (The Odd Couple), Lee J. Cobb (The Exorcist, On the Waterfront, The Virginian), E.G. Marshall (The Defenders), Edward Binns (North by Northwest, Patton) and Robert Webber (The Dirty Dozen, 10').The film did very well in the box office and would be nominated for three Academy Awards (Best Director, Best Picture and Best Writing of Adapted Screenplay) and was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant in 2007.Decades later, the original teleplay would inspire a 1997 TV film adaptation by William Friedkin, as well as other adaptations in different parts of the world.And now, 12 Angry Men will received its Criterion Collection Blu-ray and DVD release in November 2011.  The release will include both the 1954 teleplay and the 1957 film adaptation.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:12 Angry is presented in its original monaural soundtrack.  While the Blu-ray definitely has the edge with its lossless LPCM 1.0 soundtrack, because it is 1.0 and limited in dynamic amplitude, the DVD monaural track is very clear.  Dialogue is understandable and I detected no hiss or crackle while watching the film.According to the Criterion Collection, the soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from a restored  35 mm magnetic track and clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.SPECIAL FEATURES:12 Angry Men - The Criterion Collection #591' DVD comes with the following special features:Disc 1:The Television Version -  (50:43) Frank Schaffner's 1954 television version that aired on Westinghouse Studio One (on CBS back in Sept. 1954)The Television Version - Introduction by Ron Simon - (14:03) Ron Simon, curator at the Paley Center for Media looks at the importance of the teleplay and its impact on live television.12 Angry Men: From TV to Big Screen - (25:32) Film scholar Vance Kepley looks at the evolution of 12 Angry Men form teleplay to film.Original Theatrical Trailer - (:30)  The original theatrical trailer for 12 Angry Men.Disc 2:Sidney Lumet - Archival interviews with director Sidney Lumet by his friend and collaborator Walter Bernstein.

From its powerful ensemble performances, wonderful screenwriting and its creative cinematography, there is no doubt in my mind why this film continues to live on, discussed and analyzed.My first introduction to 12 Angry Men was in psychology class when I was a teenager and over the years, I have seen this film on video, on cable television and now watching the Criterion Collection release of this important film, it's a film that continues to succeed in many levels and has its relevance today.Clever writing that goes to show how many people are quick to judge.  Even today, with many high profile cases, many wonder how people are able to acquit an individual on charges and I always think about this film.  What we are presented in media is one thing, but the burden of sending one to prison for life or for a death penalty, it requires a group of jurors to be in unison and not have reasonable doubt.The 1957 film does a magnificent job in showing viewers how people are quick to judge but even goes further than the teleplay in giving us the character's background but also to bring in more character development in order to show the viewers why the jurors think they way they do.For example, juror #7 (played by Jack Warden) is a man who is more bothered by he heat and humidity and worry about not missing a baseball game than the actual case, so he goes with the flow of guilty and is seen as a man with no moral scruples.  While juror #10 (played by Ed Begly) is a man who will automatically vote guilty because of the young man's upbringing.  He grew up in the slum, thus he is automatically a deviant.  And then there is juror #3 (played by Lee J. Cobb), a man who worked hard all his life but the viewer is tipped off that there was some sort of disagreement that led to him and his son not talking, and thus this case of a son murdering his father tends to have some influence on his anger to push for guilty.12 Angry Men is a title that explains the emotions that come out during the deliberation.  Juror #1 (played by Martin Balsam) ends up being the man in charge of getting everyone to vote.  And we see his temper being tested when people speak out of turn.  Juror #5 (played by Jack Klugman) starts of quietly until he hears juror #10 continue his ranting of how people from the slum are bad people and then finally speaking out and telling everyone that he is from the slum.  When a juror #3 starts yelling at the older juror #9, juror #6 is offended how anyone can disrespect and elder and comes to the point where he wants to defend the older man by fighting juror #3.What writer Reginald Rose was effective in his screenplay was to develop 12 characters and making the viewer interested in them. Intelligently written, wonderful performances by its talent, then you have the cinematography of Boris Kaufman (On the Waterfront, Splendor in the Grass, The Pawnbroker) who is able to use a variety of shots in the single room to make us feel the uncomfortable humid heat the the jurors are facing.From the shots of the broken fan, the beads of sweat that are flowing through the heads of the individuals, the sweat that is showing on their necks and underarms.  But also the efficacy of showing us emotion through facial characterizations.  Scenes showing characters looking directly at the camera, scenes showing us anger and despair.  And to imagine that all this is happening in one room.It's truly amazing how captivating this film is.  A film that is low-budget, required no magnificent costume design, no major set design.  It's a film that relies on the actor's performance and a screenplay that gives the actor their moment to grow their character.The Criterion Collection's release of 12 Angry Men is a magnificent release.  It's one thing to have a Blu-ray and DVD release that features this wonderful film but also to include the original 1954 teleplay is fantastic.  And then it goes even further by showing its respect to filmmaker Sidney Lumet, writer Reginald Rose and cinematographer Boris Kaufman via its lengthy and wonderful special features.Masterfully created, Sidney Lumet's film adaptation of Reginald Rose's wonderful teleplay is a true classic.  A film that relies on its intelligent screenplay, powerful performances and creative cinematography, 12 Angry Men will continue to be a beloved courtroom drama that will have its relevance in today's society as it did in the past, but also in the future.The Criterion Collection release of 12 Angry Men is magnificent and is definitely a 5-star release!  Highly recommended!\",\n",

              "       \"The rare instance of a romantic comedy that stands tall and succeeds despite the trappings of its cliche-ridden genre. This by-the-numbers Adam Sandler / Drew Barrymore vehicle is rescued from mediocrity by a ridiculously good soundtrack, an unexpectedly sweet vat of chemistry between the two leads and one big, fat, steaming gob of '80s nostalgia. Sandler and Barrymore don't exactly light the screen on fire with their acting chops - in fact, most of their lines are so stiff and hammy, I'm surprised they made the cut - but there's a strange, genuine warmth that resonates between them, and the film uses those sparks to fuel a bonfire. The plot isn't as edgy and obtuse as Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore, but that ultimately results in a smoother, more digestible picture that's still not without a few of Sandler's signature left-field moments. Heartfelt and funny, it's also thin enough to need the not-too-distant throwback setting as a crutch.\",\n",
              "       \"In a land where AVENGERS rule the box office and superhero films paint the cinematic landscape year round, this little 2004 gem still stands out head and shoulders over many of them.If you took elements of Watchmen (the book, not the movie), Fantastic Four, and a dash of sixties spy movie cool...you'd have The Incredibles.The Parrs are a family like many of us. They deal with the frustration of a dead-end job, the often thankless work of keeping house, the social awkwardness of adolescence, and the sense of stiffled potential. However, unlike us, they have certain gifts that would make a mediocre existence that much more frustrating.This is where the real heart of the story lies...not in the crash bang wallop of the action scenes and derring do...but in the Parr's family dynamic itself. Naturally, a movie like this asks us all to suspend disbelief. That said, I also believe that Brad Bird's approach to the family situations hit the nail on the head with a very believable hammer. They are as real a family as anything I have ever seen on television or film before. I know exactly how Bob Parr feels when he climbs in that stuffy car and fights traffic to a job that he truly hates...but does so to put food on the table. It's worse when he knows he's capable of so much more. Helen Parr is the prototypical housewife and mom. She's the rock. She's the glue that keeps them all from falling apart...like many Mom's are. Violet has all the shy and awkward trappings of most 14 year old girls...knowing she's different, yet feeling like she's invisible even when she's not using her gifts. Dash...well...Dash is about as average a ten year old as they come. He's mischevious and WAY too eager to show all the kids what he can do. Who hasn't felt like that at some point in their youth??Add to this a great villain in Jason Lee's Syndrome. His motives aren't necessarily about world domination or wealth and power. They're actually a bit less insidious than that. He wants the approval and adoration that so many of us want in life....but his approach is what makes his character nefarious and twisted. He's yet another well fleshed out character.Samuel Jackson's Frozone is a fun character that I wish had more screentime, yet his contribution to the story is great as middle-aged Mr. Incredible's voice of reason. A loyal friend...but someone who isn't afraid to tell him that he takes things too far.Oh...and what else could be said about Edna Mode?? Ten minutes of total screen time...yet steals those ten minutes effortlessly.One of the things about this movie that really wows me is the way they were able to get such GREAT performances from completely CGI characters. The facial expressions, body language, emoting....all done perfectly. In many ways, better than many real life actors. I see Holly Hunter in Helen Parr more than any other voice performance, but I do see some elements of Craig T Nelson in Bob Parr as well.Brad Bird, responsible for one of the most underrated and excellent animated films in history (The Iron Giant), really hits it out of the park. This still remains my favorite Pixar offering...and one of my favorite movies of all time.\",\n",

Loaded with plucky working class heroes, cute anthropomorphic critters, moments of agonizing forced charm and stereotypical corporate villainy, it still might have worked under a craftier director. Instead, a second-rate cast extracts every ounce of ham from a very dimly-written script while they flounder around a slow, dull storyline. The effects work is good for the period, a must since the real stars of the picture are the small, hovering mechanical aliens that drive the plot, but beyond that it's weak sauce even for a kids' picture.\",\n",

The plot is a bit too twisty-turny for its own good, with perhaps ninety percent of the cast switching allegiances at least once before it's through, but that's kind of its thing and I can write off a few eccentricities in the name of identity. Jean Reno and Ving Rhames are wasted as generic lackeys, though, and the vital makeup effects aren't nearly as good as I had remembered. The magic of watching a guy rip off a faceful of fake skin is sort of lost when I can immediately identify who's wearing it as soon as they step on-screen. Though campy at times, it's still worth a watch for the perfect, trendsetting blend of action and suspense it brings to several key moments.\",\n",

From the huge breasted woman in the tobacco shop to the unbelievably impressive cruise ship, every scene in Amacord resonates with memories that have grown bigger than life over time. The Italian family that provides some of the best domestic scenes is also exaggerated and stereotyped but at the same time may be the most realistic aspect of this film.The film is absolutely wonderful as a study of capturing the intersection of fantasy and the haze of recollection.

One flaw that both movies have is the use of a narrator, though while the narration does much more damage to The Killing as a movie, it isn't as obtrusive in Killer's Kiss.

It sure shows in this gem of a film dealing with both aliens and the question of fate vs. coincidence.For a basic plot summary, Signs sees Rev. Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), son Morgan (Rory Caulkin), and daughter Bo (Abigail Breslin) suddenly dealing with an alien presence, begun by a strange crop circle on the nearby property.  This comes on he heels of the death of the mother of the family, so the remaining family members struggle to deal with this new test.What makes this movie so great is that, short of Sixth Sense, it is the best trick ending of any M. Night film.  I won't say any more for fear of spoiling it for you, but suffice it to say that your jaw will be on the floor (provided you are going in blind, of course, without any prior knowledge).  The ending even fits in with the context of the overall film, which is an area in which it surpasses later works such as The Village & Lady In The Water.The acting is also terrific, with Gibson giving a poignant performance as the faithless former preacher.  Phoenix and the children characters provide some much-needed comic relief in such a dark (and sometimes emotionally dreary) film.  As usual, one of M. Night's most underrated directorial talents shines through: the ability to change the mood of a piece on a dime, perfectly blending satire with mystery/adventure without either getting stale.Overall, Signs is a wonderful movie if you are a fan of mysteries or sci-fi tales.  It even has the human touch to vault it into all-time favorite status.  Incredibly, after fooling us already with Sixth Sense, M. Night turns around a scant few years later and turns the exact same trick.  Remarkable.\",\n",

Devane tells him that he can be a hero, and strike a stand for the little man against corporations that plunder the environment, but, as McCabe is an inveterate con artist, the idea that he would buy such hippy-drenched drivel is laughable; especially considering such advice is tantamount to a death warrant.Overall, McCabe & Mrs. Miller is not a terrible film, although a viewer does not care, much less identify, with any of the characters, but it is not a good film, even if one, Heaven forfend, actually finds Leonard Cohen's songs somehow interesting, and it is certainly nowhere in the universe known as perfection, period.\",\n",

The film evinces a cinema verit&eacute; aesthetic, so the cinematography by Kent L. Wakefield is not as important as the superlative editing by Sidney Levin. But, the most important aspect of the film was how it brought already popular music into modern filmmaking, and wove it in seamlessly, as if it had been composed specifically for the film. Scorsese's always been one of the best directors in the world at effectively deploying music. But, it's the overall style that Scorsese created that is important, because, whereas poseurs like Jean-Luc Godard merely aped Hollywood noir, and tried to use their low budgets to claim novelty, Scorsese really does do something without precedent- in noir, in John Cassavetes films, or in gangster films. He creates a stylized realism that was absent in noir, affected in Godard, formative in early Cassavetes, and unreal in gangster films. Only Cassavetes' later The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie and Jim Jarmusch's Ghost Dog: The Way Of The Samurai, are as effective in realistically portraying most mobsters; as often inept bumblers whose idiocy, even more than their ethical corruption, leads to their downfall.There are, of course, aside from the classic scenes mentioned, some interesting cameos; such as Jeannie Bell, as Diane, the black stripper Charlie lusts for. Her prior claim to fame was as the second Playboy magazine centerfold Playmate, and the first black cover model. Then there is the bizarre scene with the Carradine brothers, wherein Robert shoots and kills a drunken David in Tony's bar. It's funny, but pointless, except that it's the sort of pointless violence that happens in that sort of world. There's also a classic scene, after the killing, where Michael, Charlie, and Johnny Boy end up in a car with two queers that flame. It's a hilarious sequence. There is also a possible cameo by Scorsese as Michael's shooter, in the car, in the final scenes. Scorsese did this in some of his early films, but never followed in Alfred Hitchcock's tradition.Mean Streets is not as polished a film as Scorsese's later great films, like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The King Of Comedy, After Hours, nor Goodfellas, but it is every bit as good, in its raw sensibilities. One only hopes that, now that he got his `Honorary' Oscar for the merely solid The Departed, Marty from the nabe will return to his roots, and make some films where he cannot have every whim of his indulged. It worked once. It can work again. If not, then American cinema lovers will be left with a tarnished legacy for one of its most original and brilliant filmmakers. Mean Streets is proof of that claim. Here's hoping Scorsese can finally find his way home.\",\n",
              "       \"The film that Harakiri shares the most cinematic DNA with is Kurosawa's The Bad Sleep Well. In a sense, that film is the modern retelling of this film, wherein a vengeance seeking hero plots to destroy his tormentors, only to have him end up dying, as well as having the real truth expunged. But, along with that film, Harakiri never errs by making its politics lead its art around. From the almost exact repetitions of the early actions of Chijiwa and Tsugumo in the Iyi house, to the repetition of the samurai armor to start and end the film, there is no doubt that politics is merely a weapon in the artistic arsenal; it is not its raison d'etre. But, the film also shares much artistry and narrative technique in common with Kurosawa's more placid Ikiru, which also has a large portion of its ending consist of characters relating flashbacks of what happened to the film's lead character. That this dialogue intensity occurs in a samurai film is unusual, but only at first blush, since Harakiri is, in reality, as much of a samurai film as Stanley Kubrick's Paths Of Glory can be called a `war' film. And, like films like The Wild Bunch and Once Upoin A Time In The West, Harakiri ends with a symbolic foreshadow of the future of the nation it's set in. It is no happenstance that the rogue ronin Tsugumo is not felled by another's sword, but only by guns, for that was the way the Tokugawa Shogunate, the ultimate bad guy in this film, was to fall almost 240 years later.The Human Condition ultimately missed out on greatness because of its length and overarching ambition, which sometimes obfuscated points that should have rung clarion. Harakiri does not suffer that ill. It is a deft lightning strike at its target, and as such delivers a killer blow. It also shows that Japan's filmic legacy, in the 20th Century, was more than its Big Three directors, Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, and Kenji Mizoguchi. Masaki Kobayashi seems to be every bit their equal, and, along with Kon Ichikawa, Hiroshi Teshigahara, Shohei Imammura, Nagisa Oshima, and Mikio Naruse, the middle part of the last century seems to have been, for Japanese film, one of the most Golden of Golden Ages any country has experienced in any art form.

It is also a film specifically aimed at creating myth, both within its diegetic world, and in its non-diegetic world., and it is far above even the best of the pre-Leone Western films, like John Ford's Stagecoach, or Howard Hawks' Red River and Rio Bravo. And, while it does not reach the unassailable heights of the truly great films that Leone would later make, one can see, in the film, and in its structure, the DNA of greatness that Leone gave this film, and which had been born in him. And with that gift, the man also showed the way to greatness for other practitioners of the genre, and film in general. That it would take a while longer to come to his own full fruition is merely how life mostly is. And when the wait is rewarded as well as Leone rewarded his audience, one always looks back on it with fondness. Thus, here is where the countdown truly began. Do the honors yourself....\",\n",

In a lot of ways that's a blast of fresh air, as no doubt an American version wouldn't have been half as biting, daring or dark, and its dedication to probing the unacceptable makes up a large part of Oldboy's character. It's not those stabs outside the boundaries that bothered me about this one, though, so much as it was the refusal to bask in them for more than a few instants before jolting off in search of new depths. The establishing story is almost perfect, setting the stage with an everyman who's been transformed by fifteen years of unexplained imprisonment, then following his violent, dedicated search for both suspect and reason. It's an act the tangled, overstretched follow-through can't hope to match, even when its mysteries and motivations are finally, confusingly, lain bare.

But as a comedy of manners, this version is razor-sharp in the best MGM tradition. Co-scripted by Aldous Huxley, every other line is a barb or a zinger, delivered with staccato aplomb by a talented cast. Even director Robert Z. Leonard puts those wrong-era dresses to work by choreographing the women's movements as a gaggle of Bennets march down the street or several of them float from room to room. The movie also boasts three of MGM's finest character actors: Mary Boland as the fluttery Mrs. Bennet, solely obsessed with getting her daughters married (compare this role with Boland's work as the amorous countess in The Women), Edmund Gwenn as the wise, ever-sensible Mr. Bennet, and, of course, Edna May Oliver as the haughty Lady Catherine, whose every sneer speaks volumes. (Austen purists will doubtless be unhappy with her character's benevolent turnabout at the end.) Modern audiences may not be able to appreciate the exquisite black-and-white cinematography and lighting, the Oscar-winning set designs, or the movie's high comic style, but then, nowadays, the 1940's MGM backlot is just as alien a place to many as is Jane Austen's 1813 England. In the leads, Greer Garson brings intelligence and regal beauty, if not girlishness, to Elizabeth. Laurence Olivier captures the arrogance and intensity of Darcy, even if the script has him cave in a bit too quickly to Elizabeth's charms. And Maureen O'Sullivan captures Jane's sweetness and loveliness as no other actress has done since.\",\n",

THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA explores a corner of the cutthroat fashion industry, a nerve-wracking environment replete with competitive jealousies and general, all-around meanspiritedness. Into this world steps Anne Hathaway's character, Andrea Andy Sachs, an aspiring journalist eager to get a foot in the door. To gain invaluable experience, Andy interviews for a job as the assistant's assistant to the ridiculously demanding Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), acclaimed head of the trend-setting Runway magazine.Andy is a size six, and this automatically makes her the brunt of mean jokes by those in her new work office. Andy comes from a down-to-earth place and sort of scoffs at her co-workers' unending obsession with haute couture. She promises her boyfriend cook Nate (Adrian Grenier) that she won't change. But of course she does. Andy loses her way.Meryl Streep submits yet another powerhouse performance as the film's dragon lady. Miranda Priestly is the sort of boss who can effortlessly, whimsically shatter an employee's self-esteem. I take in the twitchy reactions of those in her circle and how they tiptoe on eggshells whenever she's in the room, and even I start to sweat. But Meryl Streep is able to sneak in an echo of vulnerability. You may end up sympathizing with her a bit. This actress is just so consistently good.Stanley Tucci himself is masterful in another of his side character roles. I think every movie should have Stanley Tucci in it. Emily Blunt as Miranda Priestly's frazzled first assistant - and Andy's primary foil - is fun to watch, and she makes the most out of her thankless role. When THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA first released in 2006, Anne Hathaway was only then just starting to distance herself from her wholesome teen princess roles. So she was a question mark, going into this film, even with HAVOC and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN in her rearview. No worries, she confidently steps into this post-Disney role, and she's quite good.Because there's something innately appealing about Hathaway. Even when her character does eventually sell out, you don't hate her. You're not mad-dogging her. You just want her to get back on track. The film easily develops a rooting interest for her. Her immediate boss, the first assistant, is so cruddy in her behavior towards Andy that Andy right away falls into that underdog slot. Except she overcomes that soon enough. Andy, who is brainy enough that she rejected Stanford Law to pursue her journalistic dreams, turns out to be endlessly resourceful in meeting Miranda Priestly's incessant, impossible demands. It's not too long before the first assistant is demoted. Yay for Andy. You could feel her getting more and more sucked into this seductive world. Her long-suffering boyfriend's patience is wearing thin.This film renders me a stranger in a strange land, forced to absorb exotic name brands like Prada, Valentino Garavani, Giorgio Armani, and others I would have to look up on Wiki. I desperately longed for someone to name drop the Gap or Old Navy or Fruit of the Loom, something familiar. Gratifyingly, the story drew me in. The acting fixated me to the screen. I laughed at the right bits and scornfully rolled my eyes at the sheer fanaticism these frantic characters invested in mere articles of clothing.

              "       \"In its oblique way, Noah Baumbach's beautifully acted, painful-to-watch The Squid and the Whale uses its literary A Star Is Born framework to ask, What does it mean to be a man in a changing world? Set in 1986, the film chronicles the disintegration of a marriage and its impact on the couple's 17- and 12-year-old sons. No easy answers to the question are forthcoming in this FOR ADULTS ONLY movie.The movie opens with the Berkham family playing doubles tennis. To win a point, Bernard, the father, teamed with elder son Walt, smashes a shot into his wife Joan, who is teamed with younger son Frank. This tennis match is the only thing Bernard can beat his wife at. An insufferably arrogant college writing professor, Bernard spouts constant streams of elitist attitude about culture in general and literature in particular. He published critically successful novels in the past but can't even find an agent for his most recent effort. Meanwhile, Knopf has accepted Joan's novel and the New Yorker is publishing excerpts from it.We learn that Bernard and Joan met at the dawn of the feminist movement, when most men still took their privilege on the top of the work and family heaps for granted. Bernard dazzled Joan and she married him because there was nobody like him in Columbus. The marriage has long been troubled with affairs and other symptoms of discord. The more Joan comes into her own, the more insecure Bernard becomes, and the more condescending he acts. Your mother would never have thought of writing if it hadn't been for me, Bernard tells his sons, insisting on his share of credit for her success, even though Joan, like Bernard, has a Ph.D in literature.Shortly after the tennis match, Bernard and Joan unsurprisingly tell their sons they will be separating and they will share joint custody.  Bernard gets a house on the other side of the park because, continuing his competition with Joan, he wants a house just like your mother's but cheaper. Of course Bernard's new house, dilapidated with peeling paint, minimal furniture, and a poster of a tennis player that tennis-loving Frank does not admire, is nowhere near as nice as the family home Joan keeps.The boys shuttle back and forth miserably under the joint custody arrangement. Both parents and children act out in ways that are all the more disturbing because they are believable, and that are shown graphically. Bernard continues his how-dare-she rant against Joan to anyone who will listen. Joan dares because she's figured out after almost 20 years of marriage and sea changes in opportunities for women that Bernard is a terminal jerk and she can.If you don't want to venture into this unpleasant soup, I don't blame you, but you will miss a haunting, thought-provoking film. The Squid and the Whale offers a career-best performance from Jeff Daniels as the obnoxious yet egg-fragile Bernard and terrific support from Laura Linney as Joan, Jesse Eisenberg as Walt, and Owen Kline as Frank. The script and storytelling are finely wrought and heartfelt. Perhaps, having had to observe and endure the anguish of their parents' divorce, Walt and Frank will be better men than their father.\",\n",

It should come as no surprise that he chose this slice-of-life serio-comedy for his directorial debut.  It should also be no surprise that the film is rich in characterization.  The story, however, is a little on the thin side.  No matter because Buscemi adds another trophy in his gallery of rogues and losers with his Tommy.  When Tommy isn't drinking he's stalking his ex-girlfriend who may or may not be carrying his kid.  The assumed father is Tommy's former boss who Tommy stole $1,500.00 from and gambled it away in Atlantic City.  To make Tommy more savory he carries on an illicit friendship with the niece of the ex-girlfriend.  Only an actor of Buscemi's calibre could make such a loser somewhat empathetic.  It's a fascinating character study trapped in a film that falls short of its intentions.  These flicks dealing with life's underbelly are indie cliche.  I swear I've seen this movie before but I can't put my finger on it.  Regardless, it contains more intrigue than Armageddon so I'm giving it the pass.\",\n",

The burned man wanders into the woods, dies, and his infected body ends up in a reservoir that provides water to the cabin.With their car disabled, the group is stuck at the cabin.  One of them gets sick from the water, but sadly her friends are unable to do much to help her.  Things have progressed too far, by the time the victims finally manage to contact the locals, who take drastic steps to contain the outbreak.Like watching a ship going down to the bottom with all hands aboard, Cabin Fever is quite grim, as those in distress slowly slide down into disaster.  Not a particularly likable bunch, it's hard to feel too badly for these folks, but it still isn't exactly a pleasant experience watching their demise.  For a while, there's not much happening at the cabin, except a wild dog drawn by the blood.

Thereafter, simple doesn't seem to suffice after the deed is done, nor is it simple as it unfolds in motion.  I didn't see the original version, coming late to discover this gem, but I wish I had.  The story line is excellent, even though the basic idea of the plot has been used and abused many times over.  The Affair.  The jealous husband.  The ensuing murder under murky circumstances.  That's actually what makes this film such a good one - because it took something old and transformed it into something out of the ordinary.  You know who did it from the beginning, yet you know nothing about what is coming next.  As you begin to get the drift of each scene, it brings you to the edge of your seat, only to be spun again from a different angle of stupidity that actually sounds quite plausible, all things considered.

To add to the curiosity, it doesn't even start off as wild, uncontrolled passion, but rather as well, ok, let's go ahead and do it.  But to detail the story in a review would serve to ruin it.  Suffice it to say, the Cohen brothers in the early years started out with a bang that has kept on keepin' on through the years.  A youthful Francis McDormand and John Getz play the star-crossed lovers who don't have a clue about what they are doing and prove it in every frame.  Dan Hedaya does a likewise good job in his role of the jealous, brooding husband who has no stomach for what he is about to set in motion, but does it anyway; his black, violent and tormented eyes sizzling behind the scripted words.Recommended to those who missed a good thriller the first time around.

Following the private and public trials of Puyi, who ascended to the imperial throne before his fourth birthday, it's one soul-crunching onslaught of manipulation after another over the course of several decades. Almost every single member of the cast is either disgustingly entitled or a steadfast, unwavering fanatic to a self-serving cause, including the emperor himself who often falls into both camps. He's naive and misguided, a result of his isolated regal upbringing, but also wants desperately to make a lasting positive mark on the world. It's frustrating to watch his attempts at reform explode on the launchpad over and over again due to the oppressive presence of a corrupt group of advisors, a hamstring he's never able to overcome. Though it has a tendency to linger far too long, the film is drop-dead gorgeous when it's set inside China's famous forbidden city.

Paul Reubens lives and breathes this role, (literally - he's credited for the role of Pee-Wee as himself) and he couldn't have asked for a better partner than the similarly quirky, fringe-dwelling director Tim Burton (in his first major picture). Reubens is genuinely larger-than-life in this loose collection of vignettes and skits, with the whole mess tied together with all the care and subtlety of a spaceship made of duct tape and cardboard. Even when he's not making a direct footprint on the screen, Pee-Wee's influence is positively oozing out of each frame, coating everything from the scenery to the wardrobe to the manic, impulsive style of shooting. It's a perfect interpretation of the character's famous stage show, an ideal introduction for the unfamiliar masses, and a natural launchpad to super-stardom. I'll grant that it's not for everyone, but for those of us with an appreciation for drag queens, John Waters, the B-52's and sixties housewife chic, it's a direct hit. It's that rare crossroads where unbridled mayhem, conscienceless good times and hysterical laughter collide in a loud, twisted, dirty ball of pandemonium.

You really can't blame the actor - he was hand-picked by George.  There's a segment in one of the bonus features (on my Episode I DVD, not in this Blu ray 3 pack) that shows Lucas intently scrutinizing one of Lloyd's performances. What is going on in the man's mind is unfathomable, but the end result is dismal.Then we have Jar Jar Binks,  probably the most universally despised computer animated character that will ever  grace a big budget movie.

Clearly Clift is doing something wrong here, stringing along a poor, pregnant woman while also falling deeply in love with Taylor. But both women adore him. He never meant to do any harm. He has done his best, all his life, to do what's right and to care for his family. Somehow things just go horribly awry for him and even in the depths of his despair he tries to do the right thing.It's amazing that Taylor was only 17 when she played this role, and that this, her first on-screen kiss, came only a few weeks after her first in-real-life kiss. Winters, up until now cast as a bombshell, desperately wanted the plain Jane role to show she had merit within her as well as without. And Clift shows his range of acting ability as he plays his desperation, his adoration, and his humanity.So many one-night decisions we all make in life have ramifications that follow us for the rest of our years. How do we handle them? How do we react to pressures? It was just one night that Clift crossed over the edge into passion, and it was going to affect every step he took from that day forward. In 1951 the topic of abortion and unmarried women carried a lot of weight. Winters has to lie to the doctor about her state, and she feels the shame of it. Look at how the workers in the factory refer to the girls and how the supervisors (men, of course) are not allowed to fraternize with them.And on the other hand, there are some amazingly forward-thinking issues here. One of my favorite films is 12 Angry Men which has, of course, 12 men on a jury. But here there are women on the jury and it's considered normal and proper. Taylor, a woman, is off at college, something that the women in American Grafitti (set in 1962) weren't even considering. Now, that being said, when Taylor is at college the lecture is incredibly insipid, about how the silly little girls in class probably have harshly adopted opinions of infancy that won't survive the real world.And also, Clift is made to solemnly swear before God that he is finally telling the truth, as if before that he would readily lie.But, unlike almost every other movie made, A Place in the Sun gets great kudos for actually having a conversation between women. It is stunning how many movies feature women but they only exist to talk to men and support them. Vast numbers of movies never have two women talk to each other - they only are there to respond to men and adore them. In A Place in the Sun, it may be short, but there is an actual conversation between Taylor and Clift's aunt, where Taylor is rhapsodizing about her new summer home she's building. It is such a small thing, but so amazing! It is sad that to even see a short conversation between women is so rare that it needs to be commented on. And it's sad, too, that it can happen in 1951 but rarely happens even in modern day films.The movie shows us both how far we have come - and still how far we have to go.Highly recommended.

There's the nugget of an interesting movie here but the concept of living through a surrogate isn't given the attention it deserves, and what we get instead is the usual action romp we've come to expect from Willis, who is, in fact, capable of more.

              "       \"The fourteenth James Bond extravaganza A View to a Kill pitted 007 (Roger Moore) against the franchise's most psychotic villain, 'staunch, anti-Communist,' French industrialist Max Zorin (Oscar winner Christopher Walken of The Deer Hunter), who schemes to corner the micro-chip market by destroying Silicon Valley. Essentially, this Bond movie recalled Goldfinger because Zorin resembled Goldfinger with his wealth and his plan to wipe out Silicon Valley the way that Goldfinger wants to take over the gold market by turns America's supply of gold at Fort Knox in a radioactive rubble. Indeed, as villains go, Zorin ranks as one of the more memorable with an interesting back story. A Nazi scientist had conducted steroid tests with pregnant women and most of the offspring died, but Zorin survived to become a genius but a psychotic. Zorin and the good doctor who had been captured by the Soviets after World War II helped their athletes. Mind you, the Bond movies neither demonized the Soviets, nor did they romanticize the Russkies. The Soviets made mistakes, but they always managed to clean up after themselves. In Octopussy, the Soviets caught up with a renegade black market General Orlov (Steven Berkoff of Beverly Hills Cop) who tried to start a nuclear war and frame the Americans. In A View to a Kill, the Soviet catch up with Zorin who had been in cahoots with them in the microchip manufacturer business but the two fell out. Indeed, like all the Roger Moore Bond's after Live and Let Die, A View to a Kill takes place with in the context of the Cold War. Furthermore, while tensions exist between East and West, there is also an air of d&eacute;tente that characterize these Bonds.Although it proved to be Roger Moore's last mission as James Bond and it didn't surpass the box office receipt of Octopussy, A View to a Kill contains more than enough virtues, such as the snow pursuit in Siberia, Bond's careening car chase through Paris, and Zorin's sadistic massacre of his own men in a secluded mine in California. Original 007 composer John Barry provides a strong, atmospheric orchestral soundtrack and the Duran Duran title tune is a knock-out! The Richard Maibaum & Michael G. Wilson screenplay contains a some imaginative twists on the Bond formula, especially with regard to the sacrificial girl convention. Essentially, the sacrificial girl in most Bonds is either an agent working with Bond as in Thunderball or the villain's girl as in The Man with the Golden Gun. Oh, yes, let's not forget Plenty O'Toole who stumbles into bad girl Tiffany Case's house and dies because the villains catch her. The difference with A View to a Kill is that Mayday (Grace Jones) is not only Zorin's main squeeze but also a villainess herself. She has to die, but her death is heroic. Alan Hume's cinematography is good and John Glen never lets the pace flag in his third outing as a Bond helmer.Director John Glen, in his three outing as a Bond helmer, stages several interesting sequences. The fistfights are rather conventional, primarily those at Zorin's laboratories and in Stacy Sutton's home, but Zorin's plan for Operation: Mainstrike against Silicon Valley takes place in a zeppelin, but we don't know that until one of Zorin's associates literally takes a walk into thin air for refuses to participate in his Silicon Valley scheme. The scene opens in a conference room as Zorin explains how Mainstrike will work and we don't know until the last second that they are hundreds of feet in the air. The fire truck chase with the SFPD in pursuit is reminiscent of Diamonds Are Forever and Live and Let Die. There's a robust disaster sequence when Zorin kills a San Francisco City Hall official and traps Stacy and Bond in an elevator while setting the building ablaze. Stacy Sutton (Tanya Roberts of TV's Charlie's Angels) qualifies as the most annoyingly hysterical heroine of the franchise. She screams convincingly throughout the blazing city hall predicament. As seemingly lightweight as A View to a Kill is you cannot overlook Sir Godfrey Tibbett's murder by Mayday and Zorin's decision to plunge a KGB agent into a shaft with a whirling propeller at the other end. Actually, we see him thrown into the shaft by Zorin's men and he dies in a gush of water. Occasionally, Bonds contain gruesome death scenes that--owing to their PG-ratings--are left to the imagination of the spectator. Of course, it isn't as grisly as the snow plow scene in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, but violence does creep into every Bond.The scenes at Zorin's equine stables and the eccentric Frenchman's chteau is scenic. The idea that Zorin and his doctor pal are tampering with horse races is no doubt inspired by the characteristically decadent Ian Fleming villain who cannot help but cheat, even when he has more money that most people. Christopher Walken with his blond hair is ideally cast as the devious Zorin. Unfortunately, to be as nefarious as Zorin is, he lets 007 off the hook too easily. Bond's escape from the sinking car is slick but far from believable and the shift from the lake to San Francisco is the film's weakest link. Furthermore, Patrick Macnee's demise is glossed over too much. Patrick Bauchan plays Zorin's right-hand man and actress Alison Doody is one of his girls. Robert Brown plays M and Lois Maxwell plays Ms. Moneypenny for the last time. Bond regular Walter Gotell reprises his role as the sympathetic KGB chief, while future B-movie action star Dolph Lundgren has a moment as a KGB henchman at a race track when the Soviets upbraid Zorin. A View to a Kill isn't as bad as some might argue. It tops Live and Let Die and The Man with the Golden Gun, but it isn't as great as The Spy Who Loved Me.\",\n",
              "       \"Any resemblance between President Bill Clinton and the Harrison Ford Chief Executive in Wolfgang Petersen's far-fetched, entertaining, but woefully predictable skyjacking saga Air Force One ends when Ford's fantastic First Guy starts knocking off the villains. Nevertheless, the parallels between Clinton and Marshall appear clearly obvious. Harrison Ford's President James Marshall is married to a tenacious, headstrong wife in the Hilary mode, and they have a 12-year old daughter. (So was Bill Pullman's president in Independence Day.) Unlike Clinton, President Marshall flew helicopter rescue missions in Vietnam and received a Medal of Honor. No, the filmmakers refuse to identify President James Marshall's party affiliation, which make Air Force One impartially political, while it trumpets America's anti-terrorist stance.Andrew W. Marlowe's melodramatic screenplay shows more agility than innovation. While his characters emerge as largely one-dimensional stick figures, the dimensions of their predicaments assume nothing less than cataclysmic proportions. Marlowe's script keeps Harrison Ford leaping through enough flaming hoops to fill three movies. Like several other summer blockbusters, Marlowe's script does not know when to throw in the towel. Just about everything that can happen aboard Air Force One occurs. Presumably, with the recent spate of skyjacking movies, it was only a matter of time before Hollywood appropriated both Air Force One and the President as the pulp of their fictional escapade.The movie opens in slam-bang style with an elite American commando team parachuting into Kazakhstan at night. Using the latest hi-tech gear, they kill the palace guards and abduct an adversarial Russian leader, General Radek (Jurgen Prochnow of Das Boot), who is promptly incarcerated in a Soviet hoosegow. Three weeks later in Moscow, President Marshall stipulates that the U.S. refuses to negotiate with terrorists. Meanwhile, a ruthless ultra-nationalist Radek zealot, Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman of True Romance), succeeds in smuggling his bogus TV news crew aboard the most secure plane in the world. A disgruntled Secret Service agent, Gibbs (Xander Berkeley of L.A. Takedown), as we later learn, helped these guys obtain their security clearance. Once the plane is airborne, Korshunov and his men commandeer it, kill the pilots, and watch helplessly s the president ejects in his escape pod. (Does anybody remember Escape from New York?) Ivan contacts the Vice President (Glenn Close) and vows to kill a hostage every half-hour until Radek walks away from prison. According to Defense Secretary Walter Dean (Dean Stockwell), Radek's release would bring down the pro-American regime in the Kremlin and bring back the Cold War, so the Russians are reluctant to set him free unless President Marshall makes the request personally for Radek's release.The filmmakers cannibalize in typical Hollywood fashion every neat idea from all the other skyjacking thrillers. Generally, Air Force One follows the formula of the Kurt Russell hit Executive Decision. Both movies start with a commando raid and then shift to terrorists hijacking a jetliner before an unconventional hero makes his entry. You can tell that Marlow evidently watch the Wesley Snipes thriller Passenger 57 for one scene. Another scene features a stunt that appeared in both Airport 75 and Cliffhanger. The president here imitates the action heroes from the Bruce Willis Die Hard franchise and the Steven Seagal Under Siege movies. Finally, the Air Force One ending should come as no surprise to any Star Trek movie veterans. Anybody who thrives on movies like an insomniac will spot these plot elements. Although Air Force One borrows heavily from other epics, the staging of the action and some new scenes in the skyjacking formula boost this opus over the rough spots.Anybody familiar with German director Wolfgang Petersen will recognize the affinity between Air Force One and his earlier classic U-boat thriller Das Boot/The Boat (1981). The casting of Das Boot star Jurgen Prochnow as the heinous General Radek aids in this comparison. Moreover, Petersen sends his highly mobile and energetic cameras plunging about the corridors of Air Force One with the same dexterity that they swept through the hull of the sub in Das Boot. Despite a connect-the-dots plot, Petersen makes every dot a fire storm of intensity. The scene where the President's jet careens wildly across the airfield in Germany and nearly crashes is pretty harrowing.Ford's presidential protagonist is basically Indiana Jones in a suit and tie. The filmmakers rely on Ford's action hero charisma to compensate for the lack of depth in his inadequately sketched head of state. Shrewdly, they shift gears to the parental side of the chief executive. Ford's best scenes occur before take-off when he asks about his favorite football game. Although Marshall emerges as a cardboard politician, it's his Die Hard courage that wreathes him with laurels. Unlike those wimpy Jack Ryan movies Patriot Games and A Clear and Present Danger, Harrison Ford's hero here kills the villains. The bad guys don't slip out of Marshall's clutches and conveniently impale themselves on sharp objects. (Remember the way the Patriot Games villain died?) Marshall runs up a body count, kills with a machine gun, snaps necks, and slugs it out with rough and tumble adversaries. Ford is one of the few male box office stars who can shed tears (when Ivan threatens to pull the trigger on his daughter) and not make it look schmaltzy. Ford manages to maintain a stiff upper lip throughout Air Force One and his scenes with bad guy Gary Oldman crackle with electricity. Ultimately, however, Ford's performance qualifies as serviceable, nothing truly special like the cop the played in The Devil's Own (1997).The real casting coup in Air Force One is Glenn Close as Vice President Kathryn Bennett. Close manages to hold her own in a room packed with veteran male character actors like Quantum Leap's Dean Stockwell who constantly bullies Close to usurp presidential authority. Although certainly not the most original skyjacking melodrama, Air Force One manages to add elements to the formula and boasts enough visceral R-rated violence to keep you distracted throughout its 124-minute running time.\",\n",

Odessa, Texas is a football town, which is to say that all that anyone cares about is whether the high school football team will win the state championships or not.  The players on the team are local celebrities, and they're treated to free meals and a lot of sex and attention.  But many don't live in the moment -- they live for football because ultimately that's all that they have, and it's their one-way ticket out of Odessa.  That's the central conflict in this heavy drama.This is a football movie, and if you're seen one you've seen them all.

              "       \"I'm not the kind of person to throw a fit over movie remakes. Some are good, some are bad. [REC] is one of my favorite modern horror movies since it practically came out of nowhere and managed to keep me interested every step of the way. I didn't know Quarantine was a remake of it until a few months ago (I pretty much ignored Quarantine when it first came out), so I finally gave it a shot to see how it stacked up against the original. Rather than saying that [REC] is better in every single way, I'll simply tell you that Quarantine is nearly a scene-for-scene remake of the original. As a result, I was getting bored with the movie about 1/3 of the way through. The only thing that really surprised me was a little bit more gore than what the original had, but that was it. If you've never seen [REC], then Quarantine should be a nice surprise. And hey, if you're one of those people that hates to read movies, this one doesn't have subtitles.Quarantine is a 'found footage' horror movie, shot by a news cameraman who followed news reporter Angela Vidal during a segment that showed the daily life of firefighters in the city. Angela interviews the firemen, sees the different rooms in the station, finds out what they do in their free time at work, and even finds out a dirty little bet one of them has that involves her. After some time, the alarm sounds and they head off to an apartment building where an old woman seems to be having some kind of strange problem. Angela follows the firemen and police officer to the woman's room as they try to calm her down and take care of the situation. After a couple of minutes, the woman takes a bite out of a man's neck and it's clear that she's more than disturbed. Along with the firemen, Angela and her cameraman are locked in the building with several of the residents, including a mother and he young daughter, without any explanation. Even the police officer doesn't know what's going on and isn't getting any information. Time goes by, and more people begin to act violent, attacking the others. How do you survive while being locked inside a dark building with no way out? Breaking a window and climbing out isn't an option either- as military personnel have the building surrounded and are quick to take down anyone they can see. What's going on here?The title of the movie kind of gives away what the main problem is, and it's also the one whole difference between [REC] and Quarantine. I won't say much as to not spoil either movie, but where [REC] had a plot involving the Vatican, that's nowhere to be found here. Everything else is nearly identical to the original- even Angela's outfit towards the end! Not that I'm complaining about that one...but this is why I can't really give the movie a low rating. How can you give a lower rating to something that's essentially a translated version of something else? All the scares are still here, from a sudden drop to frantic chases. It may not have surprised me at all this time around, but again, if you never saw the original and this one is more accessible, then you'll probably get something out of it and enjoy it.I will say that my major complaint with Quarantine is that this movie's Angela Vidal is nowhere near as cool as the original's. Here, she's basically just there for us to follow around since the cameraman works with her. Original Angela had no problem taking charge and standing up for herself. To be blunt, this movie's star is boring. The cameraman is ok, but his camerawork seems to lack dynamic too. The funny thing is that here we get to see a bit more than what was shown in [REC] as far as the gore and violence goes, partially due to the lightning and angles. Apart from Angela's average performance, the rest of the acting was above average, though the apartment residents don't get much screen time, and the ones that do aren't the most interesting ones.It seems like I have more complaints than pros to say about Quarantine, but that's just because I saw it after the original, which I've seen several times. Quarantine is still a fine horror movie that isn't a toned down version of the original. I just wish it wasn't nearly the exact same movie, and had done something new apart from the major plot point that gets revealed later on. From what I've heard, the sequel is a little better since it's more of a standalone movie, and isn't a remake of [REC]2. I'll give it a shot.\",\n",
              "       \"Billed as a black comedy, this story of two stir-crazy Irish hitmen on the lam in Belgium could just as easily fall into any one of a dozen other genres. With traces of humor, suspense, romance, action and drama all stirred into the same bubbling pot, the risk is certainly there for overexertion, but the finished product doesn't fall short in any instance. The comedy is sharply witty and well-timed, the action fast-paced and fiery, the romance heartfelt but not heavy. Colin Farrell, whose eyebrows migrate around his forehead like a pair of pitch black caterpillars on acid, works a good range of emotions out of his fairly simple leading role and cleanly manages to get us rooting for him by the time the closing scenes roll around. Upon reflection, there really isn't all that much to the story - it's predictable at worst, minimal at best - but there doesn't need to be.\",\n",

There's also bits of extreme dark horror that involve torment.  However because of the humor, you don't really notice how evil it is that these rats are literally torturing people (and sometimes cats) and just assume it's somewhat funny instead.  It's just a weird movie overall!It's about a man who has the worst boss in the world.  Now people say they have the worst boss but come on, this one is CLEARLY the unfriendliest and unlikeliest to sympathesize with your issues at home.  He actually humiliates his employees despite the fact that even death itself is preventing one man (the character of Willard) to show up to work on time.  Humiliating the poor man because he shows up late to work because his mother is dying?  Really cruel man.  You're out of line!However, let's discuss Willard.  What is he?  Well he's obviously a loner and prefers to seclude himself at his castle-like home away from society when he's not working and putting up with crazy, bossy authority abuse.  He really has no interest in friendships or relationships of any kind with anyone.  In fact, I don't even believe he likes his own mother and the feeling is mutual for the way she treats him and basically says he's not man enough to do anything right.  What kind of loving caring mother would say these outrageous comments?  Not this mother obviously, since she's not the loving caring type in any shape or form!After a terrible attempt at catching mice and rats, Willard realizes that he can actually communicate with the rats.  Oh yes he has this amazing ability.  We all believe we can communicate with the animals but this guy proves it with flying colors.  He uses this communication for vindictive ways.  Oh and you can probably guess who he wants to get his revenge on, right?  Yup, the man who wants him removed from the workplace.  That plan comes together quite nicely and suspensefully.These rats grow by the numbers gradually by sneaking into the house, and bonding with the other rats.  They mostly live in the basement but when they grow plentiful enough, they spread their sinister ways throughout the household.  Willard particularly likes one rat that's pure white.  Never really sure if he was the rat in charge or whether Willard's imagination in peculiar rat heaven just makes it *seem* like the white one is in charge.  He was a beautiful rat that gave off heavenly vibes thanks to his exceptionally bright fur so maybe he was the king descendant!I really like this movie.  Though at first we're not really sure if the rats are able to understand what's going through the troubled mine of Willard, but we eventually get our definitive answer with a loud rour when the blood starts squirting and the rats are released!  These rats are on a mission to eliminate or rather, exterminate, hehe.I highly recommend it.\",\n",

              "       \"'Kids' is straightly put, one of the most difficult movies you will ever be able to sit through. That is, if you CAN sit through it all. I only did because I already have such a desensitized nature so watching continuous crude and derogatory sexually perverse language and acts for 90 minutes isn't something that will really make me flinch, although I do admit, it did disturb me. I admit I only purchased this film and viewed it because of all the controversy surrounding it upon its initial release back then, and never actually got a chance to see it.The film is captured in a documentary style, yet is a completely scripted and fictitious story. It is inspired by the behavior of many inner-city youths during the 1990's, and THANKFULLY due to films like this, and many other advances in sexual education for children, statistics do show that these days in 2012, teenagers are not as fleetingly irresponsible regarding their sexual safety as they were back then. Therefore, in a way, this film is not really all that necessary anymore, as in 2012, this film does not correctly portray the lives of what society used to see as an endangered youth of America in the mid-90s.'Kids' tells the very simple story of a few sexually irresponsible and gravely immature teenagers. The movie follows them throughout what seems to be a span of 1 or 2 days during a hot city summer of what I'm guessing is New York City when school is out. The main characters are a boy named Telly and his friend Casper, who really do nothing but try and up their sexual conquest with various girls they are friends and acquaintances with. We open the film with Telly as he is sweet-talking a very young girl (who is probably about 12 or 13), and proceeds to have sexual intercourse with her. Right off the bat, I would imagine many people shutting the movie OFF within the first 5 minutes, as watching two teenagers have sex in a film is downright disturbing to say the least. It is a fairly long scene that lasts a few minutes. Yet we know nothing about this boy Telly and at first the audience will buy into everything he is telling this young girl. Now as Telly walks out and sees his friend Casper, does the non-stop flux of crude sexual language begin, and literally DOES NOT END throughout the entire duration of the film. We see scenes of them and their friends, talking more trash, smoking cigarettes and pot, drinking, etc. We also catch a scene of a group of teenage girls whose sexually derogatory language is just as bad as the boys. They speak of their own sexual conquests and even though they admit to being mistreated, they shockingly seem to take pride in such behavior and disrespect of themselves.Keep in mind that the language used in this film is very outdated by today's standards. Kids speak in regular ebonics to a very annoying degree. Yet, at the time, that's the only way lots of teenagers used to speak, as it was sort of the in thing to do. So yea, just a film where white teenagers are constantly tossing out terms like a-ight, yo, word up, etc. It's silly, but hey, it's what was prevalent back then.The real plot begins when 2 of these girls decide to take an HIV exam at a local clinic. One girl I might add is played by a young Rosario Dawson, in what is perhaps her first ever movie role. No, she is in no way cute in this film even though she is very young, her sexually disturbed character will pretty much kill any charm she might have had. Anyway, it turns out that her and her friend Jennie both test differently for the disease. Jennie is positive, while Rosario's character is HIV negative. This is ironic considering that in the film, Jennie has only slept with 1 boy, and that is our main male lead Telly. Rosario's character on the other hand has had about 10 different partners, yet is completely clean. So after this Jennie decides she needs to find Telly and tell him about her disease, and to also inform him that he is also HIV positive. Yet though Telly does not know he has this disease, he continues to sleep with as many girls as he can, and makes a big deal about only going after virgins.As we follow these characters throughout the film we don't really learn much about them, yet the film really holds up simply due to the character's graphic behavior. In the infamous fight scene (which surprisingly enough gave this a non-rating, even though the rest of the film could have very easily done that... the fight scene was probably the cleanest scene in the WHOLE FILM considering the stuff these kids pulled) we have the group of friends beat a man senseless due to a petty argument because Casper accidentally bumped into a guy at a park while riding his skateboard. The man is beat nearly to death.The film introduces some newer characters towards the end, young friends of Telly and Casper who are even younger, probably about 12 years old, and are on the very same road to sexual and behavioral destruction. It's simply way too sad to watch because we know these children will eventually ruin their own lives due to their own pride and foolish behavior, but seem to have absolutely NO parental guides or role models to follow whatsoever. The only interaction with any parents is with Telly and his mother who is at home with Telly's baby brother. Their relationship is sad and pathetic as they seem more like roommates than a mother and son. We also get a glimpse of Casper's perverted mind as he oogles at Telly's mother breastfeeding the baby.Now when it comes to that night, all the kids want to do is party some more. In a pool scene we watch as a different young boy becomes very enticed by a young girl who is part of their friend group, and makes frightening advances because he wants a kiss from her. If things went far enough, we get the feeling that the kid would perhaps have raped the girl, but of course that didn't happen. The fear only goes to show how good these performances were, and as the viewer, you cannot help but become convinced by every single shot of it. The documentary style helps this feel so much more real than it really is.Things culminate with a final party scene where our female lead Jennie gets drugged by a friend, and still proceeds to find Telly. Telly and Casper try for more sexual conquests, and lots of teenagers passing out and vomiting. Just an extremely sad scene that is effectively disturbing. One cannot sit and believe that many teenagers actually USED to act like this. The thought is so heart-breaking that children can be raised and ignored in society so much that they build a life on looking for only fleeting pleasures, and have no aspirations for themselves whatsoever.So to not give anything away regarding the outcome of Jennie and Telly, the film ends on a low note, as a final rape scene puts the nail right in your heart's coffin, and we see how things end with just more implied hopelessness from these teenage characters. This truly was a very sad time for many of America's youth. You leave the film with a sickened feeling, about how people could be so ignorant, or could HAVE BEEN, so ignorant towards children as to not lead them in a better direction. But then you remind yourself, hey, this is 2012, not 1995, children don't really have these types of behaviors to this degree nearly as much as they used to. They also don't speak the same way, as ebonics has thankfully been more or less ignored in regular speak in 2012 by many.'Kids' is a very effective and disturbing documentary , but thankfully, it is also very outdated. While many will mistake the disturbance the film causes to be due to a poorly written and directed movie, many others will take notice that the reason the movie is so well made is BECAUSE of how disturbing it is. By the end, even though there is not much characterization, you still feel a certain something for the characters, and still have a heart for them. Because, in the end, they're just kids. So really, because this film is so relative towards its time era, it really isn't necessary anymore. Many who watch this now should definitely not take it so such heart, but instead do what I did - watch the film as an either an analytical piece, a piece of history, or just to see what all the hoopla was for back in the 90s. Just keep in mind that it IS disturbing, and offensive in many areas. So while it's too strong for many , others will no longer take this as the original life lesson it was first presented to be, but instead as a film where you just want to see what all the fuss was about.\",\n",
              "       \"Pierce Brosnan returned for Round 3 as the legendary James Bond in the franchise's 1999  installment, The World is Not Enough, co-starring elegant Sophie Marceau (as oil heiress Elektra King), Robert Carlyle (as villainous Renard), and Denise Richards (as physicist Dr. Christmas Jones), with expanded roles for returnees Judi Dench (as M) and Robbie Coltrane (as opportunistic mobster Valentin Zukovsky).  Brosnan reportedly insisted upon far more character depth and a less complicated story this time.  Fortunately, he only got the former, as much like 1995's Goldeneye, this film posseses an impressively sophisticated storyline and logical plot twists making it a very worthy entry for the now-50 year old Bond franchise.All the best elements of 007's Pierce Brosnan era (1995-2002) are present in this movie: an awesome title song by Garbage, sleek acting, adrenaline-pumping stunts, and an intelligently written script offering genuine international suspense and plenty of slam-bang for the buck.  The film's only significant detriment is the inexplicable miscasting of Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist.  Obviously, the Bond production team sacrificed credibility for eye candy, but Richards tries her best to no avail.  Even so, it proves a costly, distracting error in the film's second half when the extent of the villains' scheme takes precedence, and Bond's supposed back-up in defusing a stolen nuclear bomb simply appears so implausible.  Instead, perhaps stunning Maria Grazia Cuccinotta (seen in the pre-credits sequence as the ill-fated Cigar Girl) should have received an expanded role and participated as Bond's cohort in order to seek some payback against Renard.  Yes, it is a moot point, but the Bond production team should have already learned its lesson from similarly inept choices for Bond Girls in Diamonds Are Forever and View to a Kill.Ultimately, despite the Denise Richards casting issue, The World is Not Enough deserves recognition for a classy, top-notch Bond film that is willing to take chances in order to best serve the surprisingly provocative script. In conclusion, special kudos should be given to Brosnan, Marceau, Carlyle, Dench, and Coltrane for keeping audiences guessing as to what will happen next.  In closing, the classy final scene of Desmond Llewellyn as Q was the worth the price of admission for me, as his few moments of screen time far outclassed his buffoonish replacement in John Cleese.Rating: 8/10 stars. For ages 13 and up for some disturbing scenes re: torture.\",\n",
              "       \"After thirty years, the longevity of For Your Eyes Only is well-deserved for exhibiting so few of the campy and often eye-rolling, high-concept gimmicks associated with the successful Roger Moore era (1973-1985).  Released in 1981, For Your Eyes Only served as 54-year old Moore's fifth Bond film and five-time Bond director John Glen's first installment.  In this surprisingly gritty Cold War adventure, Agent 007 and British-Greek ally Melina Havelock (French model Carole Bouquet) are in a race against time to retrieve a top secret transmitter from a sunken spy ship in the Ionian Sea while cleverly fending off the KGB and a band of ruthless Greek mercenaries. Co-starring Julian Glover (as Kristatos), Topol (as Columbo), and the late Cassandra Harris (as Lisl), this particular Bond film pretty much has it all: great acting, terrific plot twists, genuine suspense, and the 50-year old franchise's best diversity of top-notch stunts (driving, skiing, scuba diving, mountain climbing, etc.), and, of course, a collection of scenic homages inviting tourism to the Italian ski slopes; the Greek Islands; and the Bahamas (where the  underwater scenes were actually filmed).The film kicks off with a pre-credits sequence remembering 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service, which was originally intended to introduce a new Bond actor, if necessary.  It depicts Bond visiting his late wife Tracy's grave before tangling once again with a familiar bald nemesis in a wheelchair with a creepy affection for fluffy white cats.  Although the sequence ends predictably campy, it is still great fun.  From that point on, the first Bond movie without M (as actor Bernard Lee had recently passed away) focuses on Bond's mission to regain a lost submarine missile code transmitter (called ATAC) from a sunken British vessel before the KGB gets it first.  Meanwhile, a vengeful young woman, Melina Havelock (who is handy with a crossbow), soon becomes involved, as the ruthless Greek mercenaries who ordered her marine archaeologist parents' assassination are the same ones after the transmitter.Balancing the plot's somber tone is Moore and Bouquet's charmingly platonic chemistry (i.e. see their repartee in a car chase outside Madrid), which becomes a vital asset later on as the film's pace bogs down underwater.  Further, the ongoing feud between prime suspects Columbo and Kristatos will keep viewers guessing, as Topol and Julian Glover make a fictional smuggling rivalry feel very real and personal dating back decades to their characters' days together in the Greek Resistance.  Serving as the backdrop to Bond and Melina's adventure is the wonderful cinematography.  It only enhances with each viewing the gorgeous shots of the Greek Islands and other well-chosen locales (i.e. wintry Cortina) without distracting viewers.  Admirably, the movie remains perfectly believable most of the time (including Moore's obvious age), but, consistent with the Roger Moore era, there are also some fun gags.  Examples: an amusing scene in which teenage Olympic ice-skating hopeful Bibi Dahl (Lynn-Holly Johnson) fails to seduce an uninterested (and rightfully so) Bond in his hotel room  ... or the British Prime Minister's congratulatory phone call to 007 before the end titles.I would rate this highly entertaining movie as Moore's second best Bond film (after The Spy Who Loved Me and ahead of slower-paced Octopussy) because the whole, well-balanced package (including Sheena Easton's sultry Oscar-nominated title song) is provided here.  Best of all, For Your Eyes Only is worthy of countless repeat viewings, which ultimately justifies its existence on DVD and/or blu-ray.Rating: 9/10 (for ages 12 and up for mature themes and bloodless violence).\",\n",

              "       \"There's not a breathtaking amount of originality to Splice, but it is an otherwise solid little sci-fi horror with no real lasting appeal. It's very similar to the incredibly stupid 1995 movie Species as well as having many shades of Guillermo Del Toro's Mimic (Del Toro served as producer on this film too) but plays it straight enough for it to be taken seriously in its own right.Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley play scientists/lovers working for a pharmaceutical company hoping to find cures for various diseases by splicing human DNA with that of various other creatures. They eventually create Dren, a female born from a fake uterus who initially looks like a blind, hairless rabbit. She soon grows arms and eyes and resembles a little girl, quickly after that she looks like a young woman and is treated mostly as a human, mostly.What bothered me about the film is that Dren is frequently treated pretty badly. She cannot talk, instead relying on squeaks and facial expressions, and should be treated like the newborn she actually is. But the pretty poor scientists who created her really ought to be charged with animal/human cruelty. If repeatedly slapping a bad dog with a newspaper creates an unstable animal...Splice doesn't really have many tricks up its sleeve. Vincenzo Natali plays the dead/not dead card way too many times and never really lets us into the mind of Dren. When the movie isn't trying to be a horror its an interesting study of the would-be human development of Dren and the emotions she provokes from those around her. In the end, neither genre defines the film and, like Dren herself, it ends up being a hodge-podge of half-baked ideas.The Blu-ray is in 1.78:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound and a fair amount of extras.\",\n",

Michael Douglas plays Garrison, a secret agent whose inability to keep his pants on has cost him his best friend (secret agent Breckinridge, played by Sutherland) and compromised his position as head of security for the first lady (and he's the hero!). Some guys with various foreign accents want to murder the president and suspicion of being the mole in the secret service supplying them with information falls on Garrison. By an amazing coincidence, the agent chosen to bring in Garrison is Breckinridge. From then on the movie follows a pattern we've all seen many times before- Garrison fleeing, the secret service after him, the bad guys setting up a plot with the real mole, Garrison searching for evidence to clear himself and prevent the conspirators from succeeding in their vile machinations and the climactic gunfight at the OK Corral, or in this case Toronto City Hall.It's not a terrible movie, the action is exciting and the cinematography is good- some great views of Toronto, which was my home town for 25 years.

              "       \"THE CABLE GUY is as dark as deep space and creepier than walking into a nest of fiddlebacks; Jim Carrey's eerie portrayal of an off-center cable technician--complete with thick lisp and impish grin, mind you--who inexplicably attaches himself to one of his customers tweaks the ick factor in spades.  This movie has a decided edge--a quirky, satirical spoof of our TV-addicted culture (even before the onslaught of reality TV), but it's also funny.  Outrageously funny.  Carrey's cable guy--who uses aliases of characters from former TV shows--is hysterically funny, and he's augmented by sidekick Matthew Broderick, playing the overwhelmed recipient of the cable guy's intentions.  Broderick is golden himself, as he's lavished with all this sudden attention until his life begins to unravel before his eyes.  Naturally the plot is going to rush headlong towards a creepy, dark, over-the-top ending (which it does), yet Carrey's character is given one last comedic gem as he's being treated by an unsuspecting emergency technician.Rinse, repeat, use again.From dueling one another to the delight of a medieval restaurant crowd, to playing a very adult word game, Carrey and Broderick aptly carry the freight.  Other cast members include Leslie Mann playing Broderick's lukewarm love interest, Owen Wilson as a soon-to-be-dispatched date candidate, and crafty veteran George Segal as Broderick's father.  It's very surprising to see a young Jack Black in a straight man role as Broderick's concerned best friend, and director Ben Stiller gets in on the fun making a cameo as a former child star on trial for murdering his twin brother--a trial sensationalized on every cable channel.  Yes, THE CABLE GUY is disturbing and creepy, but if you like occasional comedies that venture over to the dark side, this film is a must-see.--D. Mikels, Esq.\",\n",

A.I. is quite Kubrickian at heart - complicated, fascinating and occasionally bizarre just for the sake of it - but also so thoroughly lathered with the strokes of Spielberg that it could almost function as a parody of his career. That duality is often mesmerizing, but also quite destructive. There are a few moments where this picture shines brighter for those combined efforts than it ever could under a single master, particularly in the fleshed-out world itself, but they're frequently outweighed by the long stretches where the two visions clash loudly and horribly - as the entire third act can attest.

His cohorts include a fellow hustler played by DelRoy Lindo, and Spike Lee himself appears as another cohort, Shorty. Kate Vernon plays Sophia, Malcolm's white, and married love interest.After an arrest and indictement for theft and burglary, the judge (William Kunstler) sentences Malcolm to nearly a decade in prison, where his inmate Baines, encourages him to read more,and while there is some dispute about his having done this in reality, introduces Malcom to the Islamic faith.Due to Baines'instruction of the history of the African people, Malcolm begins to challenge the prison Chaplain Gill's(Christopher Plummer) view of Jesus as a white man.After writing to the founder of the Nation of Islam, Elijah Muhammed (the late Al Freeman, a civil rights worker in his own right), the still-incarcerated Malcolm  claims to have a vision of him. After his release, he goes to see him, and under his tuteledge, he becomes a member of the NOI, preaching, and reaching African Americans in the seedy  areas to which Jim Crow relegates them, or outside white churches where they stand outside and wait to be offered jobs as maids and butlers to whites, telling them that they can do and be better.In the meantime, he meets and marries a nursing student named Betty(Angela Bassett), and they raise two daughters.One dramatic confrontation  by  the NOI to see justice done on behalf of a wrongfully treated African American leaves quite an impression on an NYC police officer(Peter Boyle).A falling out with Elijah Muhammad occurs when Malcolm discovers that the man he had revered so blindly fathered children out of wedlock with more than one woman.CIA agents watch Malcolm closely due to his civil rights activism. A pilgrimage to Mecca where he encounters and worships Allah with followers of all races compels him to modify his views of whites. But the breach  with the NOI will eventually prove fatal.The blood of this martyr, however, will spawn greater things for future generations.Another civil rights activist, Ossie Davis reiterates the beautifully profound and touching eulogy he initially delivered for Malcolm X back in 1965 for this film.Steve White plays Brother Johnson, Ernest Lee Thomas is Malcom's good friend, Sidney, Jean Claude Lamarre is Benjamin 2X, Wendell Pierce plays Ben Thomas, Al Sharpton appears a s a street preacher, David Patrick Kelly plays Mr. Ostrowski, Michael Imperioli plays a reporter, Beatrice Wink plays an elderly lady who encourages Malcolm, and Mary Alice and Nelson Mandela remind the world of how Malcolm X's legacy continues to inspire.Two decades after this film's initial release, it is not hard to contemplate the idea of El Hajj Malik El-Shabazz smiling down upon the fruits of his struggles.\",\n",

While the others had long careers and a commensurate number of watchable performances, Monroe died at 36, leaving only a few films in which her performance lends distinction. This is one of that handful.To me, the film does not have the same impact as it did more half-century ago when I first saw it. Times have changed or I have changed. Nonetheless, the script and Direction are first rate, while the performances of the principals are excellent. What has aged is the outlook towards the sexes and, therefore, the humor of men pretending to be women, men having affairs with men, and what is acceptable in the behavior of members of each sex. This is best exemplified in the portended relationship of Joe E. Brown and Jack Lemmon as the picture fades out.Nevertheless, this is a film one should see: it is marked classic, it is still funny, it is a chance to see some of the noted personalities of the screen in action.Oh, yes, I must note that regardless of my search among books that, generally, contain the names of singers who have dubbed the singing of non-singing performer,(and, sometimes, dubbed even accomplished singers, like Juanita Hall), I have never come across the name of the singer(s) who dubbed Monroe in her various films.

Their female counterparts are no less wonderful - Amy Adams is a joy to watch as Wahlberg's tough yet vulnerable girlfriend and the dependable Melissa Leo (Frozen River) hands in a strikingly believable performance of a pretty unbelievable character - a mother of nine and boxing manager rolled into one.The Fighter is predominantly a film about family (although not a family film), showing much compassion and understanding to its flawed characters, also offering a glimpse into sensation-seeking work of journalists (HBO this time).Rent it or view it first, but most of you will probably want to own the film afterwards anyway.\",\n",

For the first third I thought it was OK, the second pretty good, and by the end I loved it. And it's stuck with me.\",\n",
              "       \"Just like every one of David Lynch's works, 'Twin Peaks-Fire Walk with Me' burrows into your brain and flashes upon it indelible, unconscious images that stay with you for days and weeks to come.  This 'Twin Peaks...' has some great moments.  It scares you; it envelopes you; and it keeps you on the edge of your seat most of the time.As the prequel and follow-up to 'Twin Peaks,' the TV series, there are flaws, missed opportunities, and (perhaps) some misconceptions that make this cinema adventure uneven and sometimes disappointing.  Even Mr. Lynch, himself, falters, for he as prime mover of this 'Twin Peaks...' (with the notable absence of co-creator, Mark Frost) competes with his other works, and maybe it is unfair to compare this work to so many masterpieces.It has been stated that watching this movie without seeing the series would be confusing and lose a portion of the audience.  I don't entirely agree, but I can only imagine what it would be like to see this film fresh before the thirty segments on television.We are of course interested in the life of Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), a troubled high school teen and homecoming Queen who has many secrets and living contradictions.  What made the TV series so stellar is the sense of mystery.  Laura's life and death were an enormous puzzle, one that kept unraveling and revealing itself through the astute observation, both grounded and paranormal, through the eyes, consciousness, and subconsciousness of F.B.I. agent, Gordan Cooper (Kyle McLaughlin).  Next to him was sidekick, Sheriff Harry Truman (Michael Ontkean) whose support, grounded the whole affair and gave it credence and plausibility.  On the fringe were sordid characters with various troubles and motivations, which both enhanced the suspect list, vitalized the story, and provided a night time soap, which was eventful enough to mock soap operas and give us one enough to find continually absorbing.Once we have connected all the dots involving Laura Palmer, there are some missing holes but not many.  'Twin Peaks-Fire Walk with Me' works best when actual suspense works into play where the presence of danger are palpable and when the dots are truly connected to the series.  This happens primarily through the medium of a painting and with scenes from the wooden fire walk area, which match and elaborate those scenes that thrilled and chilled us best in the series.'Twin Peaks-Fire Walk with Me' is the least effective at the beginning when the first murder takes place.  It isn't an element tacked on, for the fresh memories of a serial killer were known in the narrative of agent Cooper.  Yet, the way it starts doesn't help for the narrative or a set up for suspense.  Quickly, the movie finds its footing when we are transported to Philadelphia and F.B.I. headquarters.  The later scenes with Laura endear her to us more, but the intrigue and thrills are sometimes diluted when it simply acts out the revelations of her life.In the end, the T.V. series was a connect-the-dots concoction that continued to intrigue, yet satisfy along the way.  Much of Laura's life was implied and left to the imagination.  In the movie, we can see the whole picture, but it often becomes paint-by-numbers after the initial portrait had been completed.  The inevitable conclusion is already known, the killer identified, and the exposition has been laid before us.Maybe that is why the film was booed at the Cannes Film Festival.  Having an international audience, mostly consisting of French (People who often, but not always love ambiguity and enigma.  Consider 'Cache' after all, which left some lingering questions and some vague denouement elements.)  The French, after all, comprise some of Lynch's largest and most devoted fans.  'Twin Peaks--Fire Walk with Me' leaves little ambiguity, and only at times does it reconnect the awe and feelings of the supernatural world saturating the sordid lives, so permanently a part of our imaginations, making us intimate witnesses to such a colorful and darkly mysterious town.\",\n",

              "       \"[revised 10/30/2012]If an award is ever given for the most-tedious film of all time, Meet Joe Black stands a good chance of winning.The script is poor. A good screenwriter knows that most characters have secrets and lie about them -- and builds dialog around this. (Joe Black has a secret of cosmic significance.) Goldman & Wade don't seem to understand this, and too many scenes meander without developing any interesting tension. If there's anything worse than actors standing around talking, it's actors standing around not saying anything in particular.It's possible the 3-hour version works in a way that the 2-hour version doesn't. If it does, I'll revise this review.--------------------In my original review, I recommended the Frederic March original as superior. I watched it for a second time last night, and it was not the film I remembered. For most of its run time, it plays as an off-kilter comedy (it was directed by Mitchell Leisen), getting serious only in the last 25 minutes. It suffers from being a speculation on something no one has direct knowledge of -- the nature of death and the afterlife (if any). Its most-serious weakness is its failure to explore the relationship between Death and Grazia throughout the story, rather than leaving it until the last few minutes. Someone must have looked at the 1934 script, decided We can do better, and Meet Joe Black was the result. (My only memory of the 1971 TV version is that Monte Markham made a handsome Death.)I have to disavow my praise of the special effect that ends the film. It's no more than an early version of the transporter effect in the original Star Trek. It's incomprehensible that I could have remembered it as something that left my jaw on the floor. I apologize.\",\n",
              "       \"William Holden may be the star of the film but Alec Guinness leaves an indelible image as the inimitable British Colonel Nicholson and Sessue Hayakawa as the powerfully weak Colonel Saito. William Holden's character and predicament almost seem secondary to the central plot. The true substance of the story lies in the conflict and irony between Alec Guinness and Sessue Hayakawa and the morality of British soldiers building a bridge for the enemy to the best of their abilities. The bridge is central to the plot and it takes on symbolic meaning as both a monument to British ingenuity and the inept weakness of their Japanese captors.Malcolm Arnold's score is most memorable for his use of Kenneth Alford's Colonel Bogey March. This full is full of indelible sights and sounds. The unique look of the bridge structure over the River Kwai, the Colonel Bogey March and the scene where Alec Guinness falls on the plunger of the detonator box rigged to blow up the bridge have lived with me ever since I saw this film as a kid. That was a longtime ago, a time well remembered that only exists in my memory now. Adapted from Pierre Boulle's novel the screenplay (credited to Boulle) was written by the blacklisted Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson, who received their Academy Awards, posthumously, in 1985.\",\n",
              "       \"It's very clear how Intolerance - which wasn't on the original AFI Top 100 listing - somehow launched into the #49 spot on the 10th anniversary listing. It all has to do with director D. W. Griffith's previous work, Birth of a Nation.Birth of a Nation was on the first listing. It certainly represented a stellar moment in moviemaking. It earned the #44 spot in the first ever ranking of all movies. Griffith, back in 1915, had achieved quite a momentous milestone. He had made a silent film which had a full cast, beautiful scenery, an engaging storyline, and situations which would get the world talking. Unfortunately for Griffith, the content of that film was black-bashing in some of the vilest forms we have seen in movies before or since. I did a full review of Birth of a Nation, and in it I talk about how stunned I was to watch this unfold before me. Trying to judge it on its technical merits, I explain, is like trying to judge the culinary merits of a fine dinner made from chopped-up baby. There is just no way to separate out what is being experienced from how foul the whole concept is.There was HUGE outcry when the AFI put this movie onto their first Top 100 listing. Yes, again, I understand it was groundbreaking. And even so, I was not happy having it on the list.Intolerance was Griffith's next work. Even in 1915 there was an enormous outcry against Birth of a Nation and people around the world accused Griffith of being racist. He made this movie in an attempt to redeem himself. One could say that Birth of a Nation was a mere stepping stone to the even fuller presentation of storyline, epic landscapes, casts of thousands, and other lush filmmaking technologies that Griffith presented here. I.e. this is not just a consolation prize for having Birth of a Nation ejected. It really does deserve to be on the AFI list in its own right.You have to settle in for a long haul here. It's over 3 hours long, with subtitles that hang on the screen for seemingly hours at a time. There are long shots of men staring up at the sky and women staring with wild eyes at the screen. Pour a glass of wine. Or two. Be patient.You get four different intertwined stories. Jesus and his crucifixion. The Huguenots being slaughtered in France. The Babylonians being taken down by jealousy. And workers struggling to live in modern day 1916. We see how little humans have changed over the years. We still love and dream, we hate and fear, we launch out after goals and we are struck down by fate. We never know, until the end, how each story will end up. (Well I suppose we know how the Christ story will end up).And, surprisingly, where so many other movies even today barely feature a female character except to have her be a arm candy for the men, we have a wealth of characters of all styles here in Intolerance. We have upper class and prostitutes. We have rich kings and struggling slaves. We have elegant clothes and nearly-naked people. The Mountain Girl picks up a bow and fights along side the men. Musketeers - or gang lords - ruled the streets in the early 1900s. Corruption was rampant. There was corruption in the French court, and in Babylon too. Humanity faces the same issues over and over again.Yes, sometimes the film is a bit heavy-handed in its message. I think it's important to remember the outrage that Griffith had just faced, that he was now trying to overcome. To his credit, the sets are enormous and the wealth of characters is fairly stunning. So many movies of the time were just about rich white men and what they did in life. Here we get a wide variety of characters to relate to.Well recommended, both as a stage of moviemaking history and as an interesting view of the human condition.\",\n",
              "       \"NICK OF TIME crackles like a good, taut thriller ought. The plot unfolds like a good, old-fashioned Hitchcock nerve-jangler. Heck, even the score is reminiscent of Hitchcock's past film scores. I like the conceit of the story's taking place in real time. And since this film runs only a bit past 90 minutes, no sooner do public accountant Gene Watson (Johnny Depp) and his young daughter Lynn (Courtney Chase) disembark at the Union Station in downtown Los Angeles than they're menaced by two government officials, Mr. Smith (Christopher Walken) and Ms. Jones (Roma Maffia). Having gained privacy in a van, Mr. Smith spells it out for Gene. Unless Gene assassinates a prominent public figure, his adorable child will be murdered. He has 90 minutes to get it done. He gets handed a gun and an itinerary. Let's start the clock-gazing.Johnny Depp imbues his character with this unassuming trait that makes him relatable, but then he also sneaks in a dash of subversive pluck, and this makes him rootable. Faced with an impossible dilemma, Gene Watson balks and tries repeatedly to throw a monkey wrench into Mr. Smith's plans, on the sly, of course. He slips a note to the taxi driver. He approaches a cop. He waves the gun and attempts to commandeer the van. But Mr. Smith, constant shadow, thwarts him at each turn, at each try to recruit help or get the word out. And as the clock winds down closer and closer to deadline, a desperate Gene begins to contemplate doing the unthinkable. In the eleventh hour, in a harrowing sequence at a hotel lobby, Gene is at last able to convince and enlist the help of a skeptical half-deaf, one-legged shoeshining man (Charles S. Dutton). But if your hopes lie in a disadavantaged dude like that, how secure do you feel, really?John Badham - who also directed two favorites,WarGames (25th Anniversary Edition)andStakeout- knows what he's doing, knows how to exquisitely ramp up the tension. The experiment of the real time ticking clock helps. It draws you deeper into the narrative, the fact that, mostly, we can account for the elapsing minutes. Most of the action takes place in the swanky Westin Bonaventure Hotel (also in downtown L.A.), a structure that practically becomes a secondary character, so well does Badham utilize the spaces within to establish certain key sequences. In the Bonaventure, the governor of California (Marsha Mason) is scheduled to hold a political rally. In 90 minutes.At this stage, Christopher Walken is done being subtle. Christopher Walken is basically playing Christopher Walken, and it's always entertaining to take in his brand of crazy and quirk. He does exude menace. He makes you believe he really is capable of pulling the trigger on a little girl. For most of the movie he succeeds in flustering Depp's everyman protagonist. Luckily, Depp doesn't ever resort to trite action hero theatrics. To the last, he applies his wits. It lends a measure of credibility to a pretty preposterous plot. Because, really, long before Chris Walken's Mr. Smith lost his cool, he should've opted to just do the job himself. I figure, to a professional's professional, it wasn't worth it tolerating the accountant's frequent acts of defiance. Anyway, check out NICK OF TIME for a brace of unexpected (and expected) twists. Check it out for Depp's good restrained performance and for Walken's predictably showy turn. Check it out for Badham's swerve on that old Hitchcock convention in which the man-on-the-run meets and is abetted by a lovely girl. But don't check it out for that cameo by former L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley. He dates the film something awful. And maybe the shoeshining man turns out to be more resourceful and timely than is believable, and the motivation for wanting the governor dead not explored enough. And maybe, near the end, that waiter was too convenient with his cart. Still, I think John Badham pulls it off with great flair and taut execution. So what would you do for your child?\",\n",

Bruce Willis is an actor I consider underrated, for his talent certainly rubs deeper than his celebrity despite how the media may see it.  I'll always seek out a film bearing his name, and I'm usually pleased with the outcome.`Tears of the Sun' is no exception.The film centers on a Navy Seal (played by Willis) who ventures into the Nigerian jungle with a Special Ops team to rescue an American doctor (played by Bellucci) and the nuns and priest helping her.  Almost immediately a morality issue is addressed and the journey to safety becomes a lot more difficult than initially expected.Fuqua displays the same passion here as he did with `Training Day', delivering searing intensity when needed.  Willis is in top form, and Bellucci is marvelously compelling here.  The cinematography is breathtaking, and the overall construction of the film help lessen the looming reality that generalizations are being used here.  This is nowhere near as offensive as `Blood Diamond', but the reality of the weighty subject is lost in some of the testosterone.  Still, I was pleasantly surprised with how well most of this worked, and I'm sure many of you will as well.\",\n",
              "       \"Top of the line for a majority of Star Wars geeks, and for good reason. It's the ideal melting pot of George Lucas's vast, quirky imagination, his influences' knack for dark, large-scale epics, and his key contributors' determined efforts to retain a central humanism amidst all the creatures, effects and operatic indulgences. A wildly ambitious picture, it's genuinely amazing just how much territory is covered over the course of two hours. Lucas and company manage to leap from the Hoth battle to Yoda on Dagobah, the asteroid field to Lando and Cloud City, before finally climaxing with the classic Luke / Vader showdown and revelation. That's an awful lot of set pieces, not to mention some seriously powerful plot points, but smooth talking and a few outstanding performances keep the film from feeling over-stuffed or under-explored. The cast, too, grows on an individual basis almost universally, with Luke wrapping himself in the wisdom of the Jedi, Han and Leia developing genuine chemistry and Darth Vader, in a surprise twist that should never have been so effective, actually showing some signs of humanity. Although it can be hammy from time to time, those moments are balanced expertly by a wonderful series of mountains and valleys, to the point that they stop being seen as negatives and instead contribute to the picture's eccentricity. A legendary effort that's just as monumental, entrancing and electric thirty years later, it's damn near perfect.\",\n",

But when the sun disappears and a sudden storm sets in, the torment ceases, and everyone runs for cover. The cousins flee through a tunnel where they are suddenly attacked by dementors, which Harry fends off, although Dudley is now the one left incapacitated and staring into space. Harry helps him home, with the assistance of Mrs. Arabella Figg(Kathryn Hunter), a squib that Dumbledore( Michael Gambon)  sent to discreetly supervise Harry in the wake of the previous year's tragedy involving Cedric Diggory(Robert Pattinson).Harry's aunt and uncle(Fiona Shaw, Richard Griffiths) are devastated at the discovery of Dudley's condition. Before they take him to the doctor, a howler from the Ministry of Magic arrives to inform Harry of his expulsion from Hogwarts for performing magic away from Hogwarts as an underaged wizard. Before leaving the house, Uncle Vernon gloats at the news. But after the Dursley's departure, Harry is spirited away, escorted by members of the Order of the Phoenix, including his Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Mad-Eye Moody(Brendan Gleeson), Remus Lupin(David Thewlis), Nymphadora Tonks(Natalia Tena), and Kingsley Shacklebot(George Harris).Traveling through London by broom, they arrive at 12 Grimmauld Place, the  magically hidden Headquarters of the Order, where Harry is reunited with his beloved cohorts, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger(Emma Watson), as well as the Weasley Twins, Fred and George(James and Oliver Phelps), Mr. and Mrs. Weasley(Mark Williams and Julie Walters), the latter of whom takes a protective stance on Harry's behalf during the Order members' meeting when the idea of Harry's having to fight is considered, as well as his beloved godfather, Sirius Black(Gary Oldman).Harry is introduced to Ravenclaw student Luna Lovegood( spacey and etheral Evanna Lynch)during the final leg of the journey to Hogwarts. It's a relationship of great significance.But  prior to that,we learn that the Order, of which Harry's parents had once been members had disbanded but had currently recovened to combat the forces of Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). Harry learns that Corneilius Fudge(Robert Hardy)has been smearing both him as well as Dumbledore due to his refusal to accept the fact of Voldemort's return. The newspaper, The Daily Prophet has been reflective of this view.Arthur Weasley escorts Harry to a hearing on whether or not Harry will be able to stay in school. With helpful tesitimony from Mrs. Figg, and input from Dumbledore himself, he is reinstated.Once back at Hogwarts, a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, appointed by the Ministry, is introduced. The pink-clad, toad-like, outwardly pleasant but inwardly sinister Dolores Umbridge(Imelda Staunton), who was a juror at Harry's hearing, makes a cheerful, optimistic sounding speech about the new school curriculum. Hermione rightfully perceives the ministry's intention of taking over Hogwarts and imposing an inept curriculum on the students.Umbridge shouts down Harry's statements about the return of Voldemort from the start, and inflicts torturous punishment on him for clashing with her.Ron and Hermione urge him to report this to Dumbledore, but the hallowed headmaster has distanced himself from the boy.The belief (as stated in the Daily Prophet) that Harry was repsonsible for Cedric Diggory's death at the Triwizard Tournament the previous year creates tension between Harry and his roomate Seamus(Devon Murray).Eventually, amid a mounting array of school restrictions,including the prohibition of the practice of magic itself, each being posted in writing at the entrance of the great hall by Filch(David Bradley)the Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw students agree on the need to combat the situation.Teachers who clash with Umbridge, including McGonnagal(Maggie Smith), are threatened with dismissal. Dumbledore arrives from a leave of abscence in time to spare the Divination Professor, Sybill Trelawney(Emma Thompson)who failed Umbridge's evaluation test, from being evicted from her campus home in a scene of immense pathos.Students of Slytherin House of which Umbridge is an alumnus, including Draco Malfoy(Tom Felton) become even more menacing, and their bullying goes unchecked.Ironically, the head of Slytherin House, Professor Snape(Alan Rickman), is willing to help Harry fight the Dark Lord by giving him private occulancy lessons. Using a device called the pensieve, in which one's memories are revealed. Harry learns the private thoughts of others. But Snape warns him that Voldemort can use the contents of his mind against him in a duel. During one such session, Harry penetrates Snape's mind and learns an unfortunate truth about Snape's relationship with his father(Robbie Jarvis) during their schooldays.The students find a place at Hogsmeade to meet to discuss their situation and how to improve it.Besides Luna, Cho Chen(Katie Leung) gives some relevant input, and although she is still grieving the loss of her boyfriend, Cedric, a relationship between her and Harry grows.Despite Umbridge's ever-watchful eye, Neville Longbottom(Matthew Lewis) finds the Room of Requirement, in which Harry begins to teach the students, who now constitute Dumbledore's Army how to form a patronus, using what Professor Lupin taught him two years earlier.Harry proves to be an adept, encouraging, and amiable instructor during the sessions, which are highly productive. In the meantime, Umbridge recruits students (mostly Slytherins, of course) for an Inquisitorial Squad, which will purportedly put and end to the activities of Harry and the others.Filch and the squad members are unable to get into the Room of Requirement, and Fred and George Weasley even use their illicit joke shop creations to waylay Filch. Among the young magical practitioners, there is a feeling of optimism at the last pre-Christmas session, which ends with a kiss between Harry and Cho, whom Harry comforts during a private chat about Cedric's death.Back at 12 Grimmawauld Place for Christmas, Harry is toasted for the use of the perceptiveness he recieved in a dream, which helped save Mr. Weasly's life. But he confides to Sirius that he feels he is going bad due to the feeling of Voldemort's possession of him, and constant feelings of anger. Sirius reassures him, and shows him the tapestry of the Black's family tree including his mad cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange(Helena Bonham Carter) who, with other high security prisoners, escaped from Azkanban Prison. The Daily Prophet wronfully accuses Sirius Black, another escapee, of assisting her.A relevant meeting with Hagrid(Robbie Coltrane)who had been away for a while, introduces Harry, Ron and Hermione to Hagrid's gigantic half-brother, Grawp(Tony Maudsley)in the woods takes place during that term. Hermione does an impressive job of asserting herself when dealing with him.Ultimately, Umbridge, and the Inquisitorial Squad break into the Room of Requirement and apprehend those partaking in ilicit activities. Before Harry, Fudge, and Shacklebot, Dumbledore takes the blame for Harry's activities and with his phoenix, Fawkes in tow, manages to avoid arrest.Cho becomes an outcast for disclosing information about the goings-on in the Room of Requirement. But it will later be revealed that an illegal curse was used on her to get her to talk.While students struggle through their OWL (Ordinary Wizarding Level) exams, for which they were ill-prepared due to the school's refusal to teach students how to pass them,before an imperiously corrupt Umbridge, who is now Headmistress of the school, Fred and George Weasley bolt from the school an a moment of impressive rebellion, amid the cheers of the students and a few staff members. At that moment,another burning sensation on the scar Voldemort gave him, along with various images will reveal to Harry that his godfather is in danger.Harry, Ron, Hermione, et. al try to get to London to confront the villianous forces in the Ministry by way of the chimney in Umbridge's office. But they are caught. In a maneuver in which she proves herself to be too slick for the room, Hermione devises a plan to get Umbridge out of the way once and for all by recalling an earlier rendevous with an acquaintance from the Forbidden Forest.Along with Luna, Ginny Weasley(Bonnie Wright), Neville, Ron, and Hermione, Harry flies to London on thestrals( inside-out horses with wings) where the main drama of the story takes place. Lucius Malfoy(Jason Isaacs) is the first death-eater to confront the young wizards, who while, surrounded, find members of the Order of the Phoenix in their corner.Before the dramatic battle ends, and Harry and Dumbledore vindicated, Harry will lose one more person he has come to love.After his temporary possession by the Dark Lord ends, he tells off his great archnemesis, reminding him that he is weak because he will never know love or friendship.Harry accepts the consolation of his friends and mentors once again, and as we anticipate the ultimate and final confrontation between the young wizards and their would-be destroyer, the youngsters know they are on the side of right, and on that hopeful note, we leave them.\",\n",

I did not care for it much when this movie first came out, but my dislike is softening with repeated viewings.The first problem is the plot...or lack thereof.  When you remember that the original is a picture book for children, getting 100 minutes of comprehensible animated film out of that is going to be a problem, and unlike the similarly challenged creators of the much better IMHOJumanji, the creators of the Polar Express movie didn't have available the obvious course of just lengthening each game turn scene.  Instead they inserted a couple of roller coaster wild ride scenes.  The extended wanderings through the eerily empty work environs of the North Pole quickly grow tedious but the long, long sequence involving losing (and finding) Hero Girl's ticket, meeting the Hobo and traversing the roofs of the cars, roller coasting down the steepest drop in the world, and ice skating with a train, is arguably the high point of the movie.  It also makes no darn sense whatsoever.  Just for example there is no SANE reason for anyone, ESPECIALLY the Conductor and Hero Girl, to be walking on the roofs of the cars!  In addition, after all of that friendship forming under pressure and adventure, I was disappointed to find that none of the children, not even Hero Boy and Hero Girl, seem ever to have met again.Note: One reason for purchasing theTwo-Disc Widescreen Editionis because it contains a deleted scene which among other things reveals the origin of the Hobo;... not that this will make this character's actions any more comprehensible though!Finally, there is the problem of the Motion Capture process itself.  As movie reviewers at the time noted, computer animation resulting from motion capture just looks creepy to those used to other forms of animation.  This is a near fatal defect in what is supposed to be a warm would-be Christmas classic but, making a virtue out of a necessity, turns out to be just what you want when making a creepy instant Halloween classic likeMonster House.\",\n",

It's a dark, biting and sarcastic take on the tale that's set firmly in the murk of the corporation-friendly '80s, but it completely falls apart on the back nine. The first act is an inspired lampoon of bad network television (and the bad network executives behind it) with Murray, deliciously sinister as the worst boss in America, at the height of his powers. It's when the narrative tries to cram in a tepid love story and a sudden, jolting redemption that the cornerstones begin to crumble. This really could've worked if it didn't wear its intentions and inspirations so garishly on its chest, but subtlety is, sadly, not among the picture's attributes. A riotously fun opening forty minutes, followed by an uncomfortably transparent closing sixty.\",\n",

Like the ubiquitous creatures at the heart of the plot, Gremlins delights in mayhem. The proud owner of a restless spirit and a tendency to rattle the gearbox at the slightest hint of a lull, the film can be splendidly unpredictable, charmingly sweet and morbidly profane, sometimes all within the same scene. It's vividly violent, often shockingly so, but still touts a wild sense of humor and an unexpected knack for sentimentality. I was pleasantly surprised at the lengths it was willing to go to, considering no member of the cast indispensable, and that left me hooked right up until the closing showdown. It's not the perfect picture - there are holes in the plot large enough to roll a bulldozer through - but as a sharp, silly change of pace in the holiday season, one could do far worse.\",\n",
              "       \"After two previous Bond outings, Pierce Brosnan was able to hone in his Bond persona and turn in perhaps his best overall performance as the British spy in The World Is Not Enough.  Sadly, after an incredible first act, the second half of the film drags it down almost two whole stars.For a basic plot summary, World sees Bond (Brosnan) up against the Russian baddie Renard (Robert Carlyle) for control over a key oil pipeline.  Along the way, Bond runs into a few beauties (Sophie Marceau & Denise Richards), gets his orders from M (Judi Dench), and receives the gadgets from Q (Desmond Llewelyn).The first half of the film is some of the best Bond action ever.  Brosnan is incredibly slick, his chemistry with Marceau is palpable, and the action is full-throttle without being over-the-top.  Basically, Bond is firing on all cylinders.However, when Renard is introduced (and proves to be nothing ever close to menacing) this film takes a sharp nosedive.  Only adding to the misery is the terrible acting from Richards.  I know that Bond girls are usually seen but not heard, so to speak, but I think one can say that Richards is the worst of the worst by quite a large margin.Overall, The World Is Not Enough is a very fun Bond outing until it nosedives about halfway through.  My exact rating would be 3.5 stars, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt because of how much fun I had in the first half.\",\n",
              "       \"If there's one film from the 2000s that's guaranteed to tickle your funny bone as much as it tests your gag reflex, it's Feast. Produced under the Project Greenlight umbrella, the debut effort from director John Gulager became a cult classic for horror fans almost immediately upon impact. With its tongue planted firmly in cheek, the film mixes ample amounts of gore with equal parts humor with purely entertaining results.Almost like Tremors meets From Dusk `Till Dawn (and maybe a little bit of Roadhouse) a group of rag-tag survivors find themselves trapped in a dive bar while bizarre creatures with an insatiable appetite for human blood lurk outside. With hardly any likeable or moral characters among the bunch, it's anyone's guess as to who will survive (albeit with a killer hangover) and who will be turned into pub food for the unwelcomed patrons. Will Henry Rollins lead the crew to victory in his pink sweatpants? Or will Jason Mewes  -- sans Silent Bob -- turn out to be the unlikely hero? One thing is for certain, there are a lot of characters and plenty of potential for unfortunate circumstances.While the film is admittedly rather low-brow, it gets by with a lot of charm thanks to its script by late-Saw series scribes Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton.  There are a lot of characters to sift through in the film's brief 80 minute run-time, and not only are most of them set up and defined rather well early on, but the pace never lets up for one minute, resulting in a powder-keg of horrifying action. Whether it's the over-the-top visuals or the constant feeding frenzy of action, Gulager keeps things fun and fresh, ensuring that you'll never want to look away for fear of missing something truly grim and/or gross.With a plethora of visual gags that will make you, for lack of a better term, gag and a relentless sense of humor, Feast more than lives up to its name for lovers of b-horror. While those who revel in such madness will likely binge on all the film has to offer, those with a weak stomach and an even weaker sense of humor would be advised to purge themselves of this film immediately.\",\n",
              "       \"The original 1969 film (which garnered John Wayne an Oscar) is a cinematic icon, yet it's a tad sanitized and whitewashed.  The Coen brothers' 2010 version of TRUE GRIT is a rugged, gritty (pardon the pun), more realistic depiction of a 19th Century manhunt in the Indian Territories.  (And in this reviewer's opinion a much more enjoyable version than its predecessor.)  Viewers of the original film will instantly recognize much of the dialogue has been plugged into the Coen brothers' remake, and it's grand fun to hear Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, and Hailee Steinfeld repeat several juicy lines first uttered by Wayne, Glen Campbell, and Kim Darby.  Thus the modern version pays affectionate homage to the original.We're all familiar with the story:  Young, determined Mattie Ross hires Marshall Rooster Cogburn--a man known to have true grit--to leave Fort Smith and go into the Indian Nations to capture outlaw Tom Chaney and bring him to justice for the murder of her father.  They are joined by a Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf, and over the course of their search they cross paths with Chaney and a band of outlaws riding under the direction of Lucky Ned Pepper.  Mattie does see Chaney meet his maker, yet during this encounter she falls victim to a rattlesnake bite, forcing Rooster to ride a horse to death in order to save her life.  There's a decided twist from the original, in that the film ends with 38-year-old Mattie journeying to a Wild West Show in hopes of meeting (and thanking) Rooster, who is traveling with the show--yet unfortunately, Rooster has died only days before.Bridges is stellar as ornery, hard-drinking Rooster, while Damon is light years better as LaBoeuf than wooden Glen Campbell.  In fact, Steinfeld, Bridges, and Damon all play well off one another, augmented by solid performances from Josh Brolin as Chaney and Barry Pepper as Lucky Ned.  There is violence and gore in this remake not for the faint of heart, but again, this version is grittier, more realistic, and meaner than its predecessor.  As a matter of fact, this Coen brothers' remake of TRUE GRIT stands alone on its merits as one very good Western.--D. Mikels, Esq.\",\n",

This suggests that his style ofmovie is an acquired taste. The directors have taken on manyrisks in this work, mainly in regards to its commercialpotential.The script, as a concept, has the right ingredients, the rightstructure, with many right decisions, such as that touching onthe filming locale (Australian landscapes and its desert)reinforcing its natural beauty.Here, Kate Winslet, plays Ruth, (who is no match for HarveyKeitel's acting, playing PJ Waters .) He is a self-professedexorcist to those under the mindcontrol of cultists.Although, KW's physical charisma is admirable, she seems tostruggle a bit in relaying visually a depth occasionally over the90 minutes. Overall, she delivers in terms of the role, but quiteless naturally than HK.So, this will be a difficult film to watch, and an unpleasant oneat that, by many viewers, partly  from the controversial aspectsthat are touched upon, but mainly from the mature subject mattershown.Of course, the story would not have been the same withoutpresenting those elements,  and neither would the sensationalistaspect be as effective without the extensive eye-candy, (from thesparseness of clothes that is the case  in much of the movie, bythe actresses.)At the same time, the story is paradoxical. Intuitively, at theoutset of the picture, viewers  guess that the story willreinforce their self-righteousness in regards to the superiorityof  Western and North American culture - only to see it theprotagnosist fall  into a jumble of moral, ethical, professionaland personal chaos. That is, Keitel's character loses it timeand again, falling prey to human weakness of character.In sum, on the one hand, viewers may find the artistic aspectrelaxing, ( in the way of Claude Monet's and Renoir's paintings,for ecxample) from the Australian scenery and calm pacing of thestory. On the other hand, given that this DVD is a niche-movie(not for the masses) it may be indigestible to most of thegeneral public, except the fans.\",\n",

The parkour and hold'em scenes in particular already feel out-of-touch, with both fads freshly occupying the rear-view mirror, but that's hardly a fresh hurdle for the series to clear. Daniel Craig makes for a far better Bond than I'd hoped, especially during the nail-biting action scenes or the prerequisite mingling with the high-cultured elite. He isn't the quip-slinging lady killer that Connery or Brosnan were, at least not yet, but he's twice as convincing when the time comes to flex a little muscle (or leap from one precariously-perched construction crane to another, as it were). This isn't a perfect effort - the poker climax is recklessly telegraphed, and the final forty minutes feel like a weepy, long-winded epilogue - but it is an action joyride, stuffed with clever winks and nods at the character's past, and one of the best Bonds ever made.\",\n",

Always known for his aloof attentiveness to minutiae, now Sherlock Holmes is also a skilled fighter, capable of putting his keen inferential skills to the task of incapacitating his opponents in hand-to-hand combat.  Watson has also been upgraded, more in keeping with the books than with film and television depictions, to something much more than an assistant and sidekick - in spite of his reluctance and longing for domestic tranquillity, he's a serious fighter, like Holmes, and achieves with effort the insights that Holmes intuits.It's a classic mismatched buddy formula, that should be familiar from theOdd CoupletoFerris Bueller's Day OfftoLethal Weapon, only this time the fate of the world is at stake as an evil supervillian sets his sights on world domination.  The film throughout is a visceral thrill ride, that punches you in the gut but keeps the brain ticking (even if everything gets explained every several minutes in case you weren't paying attention).  In the end it all amounts to not much more than an exciting couple of hours on the edge of the seats, but very few films even deliver that much.  I had fun.The cyberpunk London is suitably overcast and grimy, the gadgetry and magical accoutrements are plausibly laid out and constructed, most of the characters inhabit their roles nicely, even if they aren't as fully fleshed out as I'd like to see, but Robert Downey, Jr's melancholic charm and bitter wit is amply on display, always fun to watch.  The cinematography works, even if it gets a bit too choppy for my tastes - I expect that from a Guy Ritchie film - and in spite of a few soft spots and gaps the story rolls along nicely.  You can't go wrong with this one, it's a lot of light fun, unless you can't stand the sight of muscled men inventively pummeling one another every few minutes and clever men bickering jealously like an old married couple nearly as often.On the discs: the package comes with two discs - the Blu-Ray disc with the movies and extras, and a dvd disc with the movie and a digital copy.

Now, the beautiful vampiress Regine and her fiendish entourage have arrived seeking revenge against those responsible for her brother's death! William Ragsdale and Roddy McDowall return for another spooky adventure care of the talented Tommy Lee Wallace, who steps in to direct for series creator Tom Holland. Wallace gives us many more ambitious and atmospheric moments, including a werewolf's vertical ascent up the dormitory wall, several swooping crane shots from the wings of the bat, Regine's swirling appearance out of the mist in Charley's dorm room, and the grand entrance into Regine's lair that is suddenly lit by hundreds of candles. These touches keep with the Gothic traditions of the original FRIGHT NIGHT, but are updated with more modern make-up and special effects. This is where the lower budget is most evident, however, since the costumes fall slightly behind the incredible work that was shown before. Julie Carmen is dark and mysterious as the temptress Regine, although she does not have quite the presence as her toothy counterpart, Chris Sarandon. Unfortunately, Roddy McDowall is given few moments to shine this second time around, as his character simply goes through the same motions as he had in the first film. Jon Gries, Brian Thompson, and Russell Clark, on the other hand, provide memorable bits playing Regine's evil cohorts.

While the basic plotline follows closely in line with the original, it becomes all the more convoluted and jokingly unrealistic when Kimberly begins using precognition to unravel Death's plan rather than simply relying on her instincts as Alex had done in the past.

              "       \"The film's technical aspects are solid, such as Max Steiner's scoring and Sidney Hickox's camera work, which does not rely on close-ups, rather emphasizing the greater picture; but neither is the compelling feature that one finds in the best films noir; another reason this film fails that claim. The screenplay, by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts, from a tale by Virginia Kellogg, is good, but not great. Like many of the same era thrillers by Alfred Hitchcock it is larded with too much Freudianism and not enough realism (note how Fallon assumes the role of Jarrett's confessor and benefactor after he learns Ma Jarrett is dead). Still, given that it was coming out at a time when the 1930s gangster film era was fading, the genre had to go somewhere. Also, the film, while it does a good job in setting Fallon up as the mole, meanders too much. The whole Big Ed-Verna romance is overdone because it's obvious that Big Ed has no chance against Jarrett, and the whole Ma-Jarrett relationship, like that, a decade later, in Psycho, is just a bit too forced. In fact, it gets to the point that Ma, not Verna, can be seen as the femme fatale in Jarrett's life that leads him to doom (even as she is dead), one of the few points one can argue in favor of White Heat being a film noir. The best part of the film is the acting. Wycherly, as Ma, is very good, and Edmond O'Brien shows why he was an Oscar caliber actor in a very good portrayal of Fallon/Pardo. But, as usual in his films, Cagney not only is brilliant, but he dominates the screen. It's interesting to note that the 1950s saw the rise of the Method Acting style, yet almost all of the discernible physical inflections of that style were present in Cagney's role here, as well as in earlier roles. In fact, I would argue that Cagney was not only the most influential actor in American film history (for look how much of Method Madness stole from him), but also the most important and nonpareil (if not perhaps the best) for look how many imitators Brando and De Niro have had, but who can do Cagney without falling lamely short? This is because Cagney is not aiming for realism in his performances, but feelism- he aims to make the viewer feel things, not be uplifted.White Heat is not a great piece of cinema, but it's damned good. It's a bit too reliant upon the formulae of gangster films to break too much new ground, but it is crisp, taut, and there are only a few moments that are lulls. There is no higher ideal being trumpeted, but what little music it plays it plays well, as a great genre piece of cinema. Yet, oddly, unlike Cagney's earlier gangster classic, The Public Enemy, this film, while more realistic, in terms of its science and the politics of crime, is less realistic, in terms of its characters' motivations and development. Still, it's a treat to watch, and far above what passes for action or thriller fare today. In terms of being able to pull off a tough guy role, yet still move a viewer, Cagney was and is is still king!\",\n",
              "       \"The film has some surprisingly good camera work by Ernest Haller, who often makes the most out of scenes that could have been workaday, some exceptional scenes of dialogue between the two screen titans, and some well and judiciously placed scoring, by Frank DeVol. There are some trite scenes and moments, as well as some repetitive scenes. For the former, see the murder of Elvira, where the viewer just knows that when she lays down the hammer she has doomed herself to a braining by Jane. For the latter, see the scenes showing Jane taking Blanche out of their home in a wheelchair- just as she had with Elvira's corpse. Also, the scenes with the sisters' neighbor, played by Anna Lee, add nothing. Another annoyance are several scenes where Blanche and Elvira are `racing against time' to do things before Jane returns in her car, but are things which would take only a few seconds to accomplish versus the reality that Jane's errands would take her far longer to accomplish. This missynchronicity rents the `realism' that the film, by and large, hues to.But, other than that, this film largely succeeds, and rises well above the claims of campiness that have dogged it. What Ever Happened To Baby Jane? is not great filmmaking, but it is not a B film, nor schlock. From the obsquiouusness of Buono's Flagg to the taut fear and control neediness of Crawford's Blanche to unexpected shots that subvert expectations, the film has simply terrific moments that derivative films that followed it, like Aldrich's later Davis vehicle, Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte or Rob Reiner's Stephen King penned ripoff, Misery, cannot touch. My recommendation is that anyone coming to the film, for the first time, avoid reading too much about it, as well as any of the volumes written about Crawford's and Davis's egoistic battles, and just let What Ever Happened To Baby Jane? wash over them. Yes, many people will, like critics and fans, imbue their own misinterpretations into the film. But, for that small group of people with a clear mind and an appreciation for great things, even if sandwiched between mediocre moments, the film will be a revelation whose joys reach into not only one's heart and wit, but also into one's mind, that place where humanity begins and ends.

Obsessed is obviously the same piece of junk; but it is a much more fun, popcorn movie piece of junk.Derek's (Idris Elba) marriage to Sharon (Beyonce Knowles) is so stable and hot-- they make love on the bedroom carpet of their beautiful new house-- he, unlike Michael Douglas in Fatal Attraction, won't even THINK about having an affair.And twisted Lisa tries so hard to seduce him (in the Men's Room, parking garage, etc.). Elba is such a dull actor, he's not the type anybody would flip their lid for.  Now, L.L. Cool Jay would have been perfect casting--AND PERFECT eye candy in the role. Jerry O'Connell co-stars as Elba's office pal with a very liberal attitude towards office hanky-panky, and Christine Lahti is an investigator who needs a few more brains in her head.Don't worry, though, Beyonce is not going to play the victimized wife to any degree. Beyonce brings her Diva Attitude to the wife role-- and thank God! Things don't get interesting until Larter attempts suicide; and Beyonce tells dull Elba to get the hell out of her house!

Instead, he kind of develops a really interesting and entertaining coming of age romance involving two very different souls venturing from troubled Ireland to the America's during the 1800's land giveaway in Oklahoma.  With such control over development, this cult classic really builds a believable love story where opposites attract in a way that never feels forced or gimmicky.I'm really shocked I love this movie as much as I do.Tom Cruise stars as Joseph Donnelly, a young poor boy living with his father and two brothers.  He's a little guy, but tough as nails and when his father dies and some wealthy landowners burn down his home he sets off to set matters right.  His plans backfire when he meets the daughter of that landowner, the beautiful Shannon, a girl with modern ideas stuck in a world where she is boxed into a very aged society.  She sees Joseph as her escape and together they run off to better their lives in America.  America isn't as inviting as they initially expected it to be, and when Joe falls in with an underground scene of criminal boxers he becomes the talk of the town until his passions for Shannon cloud his judgment and soon the pair is left to fend for themselves in the most drastic of circumstances.Despite a really shoddy accent from Mr. Cruise (it may be near accurate, but it feels fake on his tongue) and a preposterously horrid performance by Barbara Babcock (she's always terrible), this film excels thanks to a beautifully woven story that is dramatic, romantic and cleverly whimsy (the ending is perfect) and a marvelously centered performance from Kidman and some sharp direction from Howard, not to mention the beautiful cinematography.  It is just a great watch that balances entertaining and poignant at the same time, building a real `story' and never forgetting to engage the audience in something they want to see.Forget about the fact that Tom Cruise is dressed like an overweight lesbian in the final Oklahoma race sequence, this film is oddly perfect.\",\n",

Some of it works, some it bores. It could have made a perfect 85 minute movie if the crap was cut out.The first segment is enough to put you off completely. We have to suffer blips and bloops twinkling across the screen as acid-trip visuals match the music that is being played (Toccata and Fugue in D Minor). Kind of like turning on the spirograph-like visuals on Windows Media Player. This is a bad way to introduce the film and it's techniques. I can only imagine the audience of the time watching it and thinking 'What the hell is this?' The good segments in the movie are the story of the Dinosaurs to the music of The Rite of Spring, the over publicized Sorcerer's Apprentice, The Nutcracker Suite and A Night on Bald Mountain. All effect a wonderful atmosphere that is so lacking in modern animation.Segments featuring dancing Alligators romancing fat hippos (The Pastoral Symphony) or the 'meet the soundtrack' interstitial are yawnfests with pretty much nothing happening at all, I'm sorry to say. The animation is always top-notch however and very vivid as Disney cartoons of this vintage usually are. But ultimately, Fantasia is a mixed bag that not a lot of people will like or appreciate. Still worth checking out though.As for Fantasia 2000, top quality animation and a sense of humor could have made this sequel/add-on a formidable animated movie in its own right. The running time of 74 minutes kills this potential though, especially when you consider that 6 of those are end credits and another 10 are recycled from The Sorcerers Apprentice, meaning there's not even an hour's worth of new footage. A bit of a rip-off.But my favorite segments is the one with Donald Duck (Pomp and Circumstance) and the one with the volcano (Firebird Suite). The music matches the story perfectly and it has some truly beautiful animation. Far superior to the ugly CGI crap we get these days. The TV show-style introductions were more watchable than the dubbed Deems Taylor segments in the original, but the sequel loses many points for not being ambitious enough.This was the first animated movie to be made for IMAX screens and the digital picture is amazing. See this preferably on an IMAX screen, which I guess will be limited to attractions as Disney Theme Parks.Both movies look lovely on Blu-ray in their respective 1.33:1 and 1.78:1 aspect ratios with DTS HD-MA 7.1 sound. There are quite a lot of extras, but this BD has not been spared Disney's habit of cramming in a thousand upfront promos, meaning you'll spend about 5 minutes trying to get to the top menu.\",\n",

And because the Senator is still of child-bearing age--and because she took maternity leave a few years before when she gave birth to a son--Senator Runyon demands the public be told if she ascends to the office of the presidency, and becomes pregnant, will she take maternity leave from the highest office in the land?  Or will she resort to another alternative?  (Wink, wink.  Nudge, nudge.)Senator Hanson, fully cognizant that had she been a he none of her past dalliances would ever be considered or discussed, sticks to her principles--namely, she tells the committee she refuses to talk about her private life.

And when President Jackson obtains the evidence to exonerate the senator from the most egregious charge, and pleads with her to come forward with said evidence. . .she still sticks to those principles.  There's a rousing plot twist that had me cheering from my couch, followed by an in-your-face address by the president to a joint session of Congress, making THE CONTENDER one grand political thriller.Allen, Oldman, and Bridges give exceptional performances, but I especially enjoyed Sam Elliott playing the president's chief of staff.  I'm used to seeing this actor in laid-back roles, but here Elliott, sans bushy mustache, is a whirling dervish of human emotion; in short, don't tick off this guy, or it gets ugly very quickly.  One star off for the tired cliches of liberals and conservatives and Washington hypocrisy that is force-fed from start to finish; but if you're in the mood for a grand donnybrook of a political thriller THE CONTENDER is enthusiastically recommended.--D.

              "       \"...death. That's the moral of Sam Peckinpah's classic 1969 Western about a group of aging and meandering outlaws who ride into Mexico in 1913 to flee a posse led by a former member, Deke Thornton (Robert Ryan). The outlaws, led by Pike Bishop (William Holden), eventually take refuge with a Mexican general and his hundreds of soldiers. When the Mexican member of the gang, Angel, is taken captive by the general for his revolutionary interests the rest of the gang have to decide whether to ignore it or make a bold stand.The Director's Cut of The Wild Bunch (1969) runs 145 minutes and features a great opening shootout and an outstanding closing shootout, a catharsis of blood; in the middle is a compelling train robbery. The material in between these three sequences isn't all that engrossing due to the fact that the characters aren't noble, likable or even redeemable, which is the film's weakness. I get the pessimistic message, but it doesn't change the fact that practically every character is an immoral or amoral dirtbag.Speaking of which, Deke Thornton has the audacity to repeatedly call the members of his posse gutter trash and the like. Well, what is he? A freed-on-condition prisoner who was once a member of the outlaw scum. At least the posse members -- lowlifes that they are -- are on the right side of the law. What hypocrisy.As noted above, a lot of dialogue and drama is devoted to character development, but who cares about a bunch of criminal scumbags? How can you devote character development to people who have no character? That's the problem with the film.That said, if you can accept the de-glorification of the Old West and the unlikable characters, The Wild Bunch is a solid Western with three thrilling sequences, including the unforgettable ending. There's a good message about the boldness of taking a stand and sticking by one's comrades, but that's the extent of the depth.GRADE: C+ or B-\",\n",

What you won't know until you see it is how brilliantly written (and acted) it is.There's a lot of good scenes, but the standout (for me) is Cusak's session with this psychiatrist. Their ping-pong interaction is so wittily constructed that it makes a screenwriter-wannabe (myself) despair.I'd love to give GPB five stars, but Cusak's relationship with Driver is not particularly engaging. Other than her hippieish, Leftward-leaning perspective, we really don't know who she is, or why she ever found him attractive in the first place. For this viewer, their bantering (however clever) seems mostly pointless and often interminable. Nick and Nora they ain't. I'm also bothered by the fact that Cusak's target turns out to be someone who can (conveniently) resolve Cusak's problems if he /isn't/ killed.

When Emperor Kuzco (David Spade) fires advisor Yzma (Eartha Kitt), she and her servant Kronk (Patrick Walburton) retalilate with poison--but instead of killing him, the potion turns him into a lama.

This time, the film tells the tale of a New Jersey teenager, Daniel LaRusso, who reluctantly moves with his mother to sunny California. Of course, he is an impatient and impractical smartmouth, but the real Daniel - the Daniel that's actually tolerable, is not far beneath his rough exterior. Due to his new kid status, he is bullied by the Cobra Kai, an overly agressive group of teenage boys that are obsessed with using their own form of karate on their weaker 'inferiors'. Daniel also takes a liking to Ali, who is of course the former girlfriend of the Cobra Kai's leader. Amidst all this, he befriends the handy man at his apartment building, a Mr. Miyagi. Like everyone else, Daniel at first underestimates Miyagi. Over the course of the film, we learn that Miyagi is really a very wise man who knows a lot about karate - the less aggressive and more genuine kind. The Cobra Kai continues to torture Daniel, and he finally convinces Mr. Miyagi to teach him the ways of the ancient art. But it is not just about getting back at his tormentors - Miyagi teaches him to use karate as a way to discover himself, as well as learning about honor, responsibility, and the like. While I would agree that the film is predictable, and Daniel could get on anyone's nerves, the true magic of the story is Morita's performance as the wise handy-man/karate instructor. Rather than just come swooping in at exactly the right time to save Daniel's sorry butt, we meet him as a handy-man first, and therefore learn about him as a person before putting him into hero situations. His performance makes Daniel tolerable, because without Miyagi, I don't think anybody could stand Daniel. Morita earned an Oscar nomination for the film, and while it was highly deserved, I can't really say whether he should have won because I don't know what his competition for the award was in 1984, without researching it. However, it cannot be denied that he displayed masterful acting talent, and the only element that made the unnecessary and very repetitive sequels watchable.\",\n",

This is more than a war movie, it's an intense, action-packed tale of a daring, covert rescue and escape  mission set in and around Schloss Adler, an impenetrable Nazi fortress high atop the  snowy Bavarian Alps.  Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood make as unlikely an action team as has been paired in film before and each gets into the skin of his character down to the teeth.  The boys are aided by a crackerjack performance from Mary Uhr, herself a bit of a mystery who becomes an integral part of the team, Their seemingly impossible mission is complicated by bumps and surprises with plot twists, betrayal and deceptions enough to keep one not only on the edge of your seat, but guessing what's coming next.  Along the way, there are plenty of Nazis to kill, gun fights, explosions, cliffs to descend, hand-to-hand fights to the death and lots and lots of fire.The desolate, cold feel of the castle and its surrounding forests add immeasurably to the atmosphere and is captured in brilliant, icy detail by director Brian Hutton, who would go on to direct Eastwood again two years later in Kelly's Hero's.

But that's not the main reason I like it.I like the whole exploration of the conflict of flesh (Shinzon) and spirit (Picard) and the debate over nature (Picard) vs. nurture (Shinzon), or is it nature (Shinzon) vs. nurture (Picard)? Like Star Trek VII: Generations, it entertains while delving into deeper themes, although Generations is better (a near masterpiece, in fact; see my review for details).Data's course of action at the end is way more compelling and moving than a similar scene in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Think about it, Data becomes the Christ figure by making the ultimate gesture of love and loyalty; an android, no less.Speaking of TWOK, Nemesis is often said to be a quasi-remake of that film, but it's not. It shares some plot elements of the trilogy (TWOK, TSFS and TVH), but that's it (the space stand-off, Data's sacrifice and the resurrection of a blank-version of himself). It's an homage, not a remake, and better than the overrated TWOK.I don't think NEMESIS ranks with the greatest of Trek films -- like TMP, TSFS, TVH and Generations -- but it's certainly a solid Trek movie, along the lines of TUC.Concerning the incredible ire the dunebuggy sequence has provoked, I'm at a loss. The landing party had to cover a lot of terrain, how else would they do it without something to travel in? Why walk miles on end when you don't have to? Besides, it's a fun scene and gives the austere proceedings a much-needed jolt at that particular point.Be sure to check out the deleted scenes; there are a couple that shouldn't have been cut, like the one involving Riker's joke on Picard's new First Officer and an amusing one involving Picard and Data having a discussion over wine.Anyway, those who keep shoveling hate on Nemesis are full of you know what.

              "       \"One thing you can immediately tell about Dirty Harry Callahan is that he isn't afraid to ignore the rules if lives are on the line -- but he's no dirty cop.And Magnum Force plants everybody's anti-hero cop squarely between two forces -- the broken system, and a secret cabal of dirty cops taking justice into their own hands. This movie is much more Hollywoodish than the first one, but it also tackles some difficult ethical issues along the way. And as usual, Clint Eastwood is friggin' awesome.As the movie opens, a mobster is acquitted on a technicality, even though everyone knows he's guilty. On his way home, an SFPD traffic officer stops him -- and then kills everyone in his car. Callahan (Eastwood) can't really do anything about this, because he's been loaned out to stakeouts because he's just so darn reckless. But more and more criminals keep turning up dead, so  they put Dirty Harry back on homicide.Unfortunately, Harry has deduced that a cop is responsible for the killings, and that someone is taking the law into their own hands -- which is a problem area, since he himself hates the system and its flaws. But the truth is much worse: a secret vigilante squad has formed within the SFPD, and if you're not with them, you're against them. Callahan is their next target.One of the most likable qualities about Dirty Harry is that he's a maverick who values justice above the strict letter of law. So it's intriguing to see him go up against extremists who are taking the law into their own hands -- he's dancing between the system that he hates, and the self-determined justice that he also hates. No easy answers.That means this all hits a little too close to home for Callahan, and Clint Eastwood gives a subtle, impassioned performance as we see Harry contemplating the rottenness at the police force's heart. But we can see the differences between him and the death squad -- they don't care who they hurt to obtain their objective, but the safety of the innocent is what drives him to step outside the box.Compared to the first movie, Magnum Force is far less grittily realistic, and more Hollywoody -- bombs in mailboxes, car chases and bad guys waiting silently in parking garages. But it's still a pretty tight story, with plenty of nudity and bloody violence spattered across it, as well as some lighter moments (Harry dealing with hijackers by impersonating a pilot).But I was a little offput by the fact that suddenly women are desperate to shag Dirty Harry. There's a character in this movie whose entire purpose is to greet him with What does a girl have to do to go to bed with you? and spend the rest of the movie trying to do that. Groan.Magnum Force isn't quite the brilliant, realistic experience that the first Dirty Harry movie is, but it's still a solid, grimy thriller with a powerful lead performance.\",\n",
              "       \"We can credit Clint Eastwood with bringing the Dirty Harry series back from the precipice, after the resounding thud of The Enforcer.This time, Dirty Harry himself took control of the moviemaking process. Sudden Impact has a more polished, sleek filming style, but Clint Eastwood's tight, brutal direction and steely-eyed performance make this as gritty a 80s noir as you can ask for. And like the best movies of this series, it dances along the fine line between law and justice.Dirty Harry Callahan (Eastwood) is having his usual clashes with the legal system over his butt-kicking, take-no-prisoners style -- especially when he accidentally causes a prominent mobster to drop dead during his own daughter's wedding. Awkward. So Harry is forced to take a vacation, despite the fact that the mobster's hitmen are now out to kill him.Meanwhile, a young woman named Jennifer Spencer (Sondra Locke) who was gang-raped along with her sister, is taking bloody gruesome revenge on the men responsible. This isn't much of a spoiler, since she admits this early in the movie. Now Harry finds himself facing vigilante justice vs. a corrupt local police force, and may have to put himself on the line to save a killer.After the stifling genericness of Enforcer, it's nice that Sudden Impact gets back to the central theme of the Dirty Harry series -- the timeless clash between justice and the law, between vigilantism and corrupt police forces. Between the deadly femme fatale, the prickly anti-hero and the moral murk, it feels very much like a modern noir story.Clint Eastwood really displayed his directing chops here, long before he became as well known a director as an actor. The direction is sleeker and more polished than the previous three movies, but it's underscored by a sense of bloody chaos that is only lightly held in check. He also knows quite well that we want to see horrendous, repulsive characters get their just desserts, and he unleashes plenty of wonderfully tense action scenes, but a rather bleakly satisfying ending.And Eastwood really brings in a wicked sense of humor. An early scene involves him casually interrupting a robbery at a diner, claiming that he just came in to gripe about his coffee -- and then he utters one of the two lines that Dirty Harry is known and loved for: Make my day.And despite a gap of seven years between these movies, Eastwood seems to have renewed enthusiasm for the role -- Harry is all squinting, prickly gunslinger who exists in his own law-enforcing zone, with his own moral code. He's a truly fascinating character who both scares and fascinates, and Eastwood is absolutely brilliant at showing the character's intricacies.Sandra Locke is also quite good, playing a pale, shy, sylph-like artist with a cold inner rage -- exactly the last person you can envision going off and killing people. And Paul Drake is absolutely scary as Mick, and every scene containing him leaves you craving his death at... SOMEBODY's hand. Harry or Jennifer, either will do!Sudden Impact yanked the Dirty Harry series back on track, and Eastwood's astounding skills -- both behind and in front of the camera -- are nothing short of amazing. It's a dark, bleak story that is sometimes hard to watch, but definitely worth seeing.\",\n",

I don't even buff my shoes. I don't know how much of Doris Day's interpretation reflects the real-life Calamity Jane. But Calamity's life is shrouded in tons of speculation, anyway. She had a rep for stretching the truth.If you must treat this film as gospel, then, yes, Calamity Jane was indeed a sharpshooting frontierswoman, a professional scout, a generous soul, and a big fibber. Odds are when, in the film, she sauntered up to the bar and told the barkeep Make mine sarsparilly!, really, that's code for raw whiskey. History - and, by history, I mean Wikipedia - states that Calamity claimed to be married to Wild Bill Hickok, although there's something suspect in her waiting until he had that ill-fated poker hand before extending that claim. Anyway, the film's narrative plays off the alleged romance between these two legendary figures of the Old West.In the perilous Dakota territory, Calamity Jane lives hard and wears men's clothing and rides shotgun for the Deadwood stagecoach. And, brother, does she ever exaggerate her safeguarding forays. In the dusty town of Deadwood she holds court, regaling the townspeople with her fluffed-up exploits, never mind that her diction is mangled and her demeanor unladylike. I do admit it's more fun to say winder in lieu of window and Chicagy instead of Chicago.Forced to make good on one of her bold claims, Calamity ventures to old Chicagy to fetch the famous actress, Adelaid Adams, to entertain Deadwood. Except she ends up with that actress's maid, Katie Brown (Allyn McLerie), who aspires to be a stage performer and passes herself off as Adelaid. So Calamity's made good on her claim, but maybe she'll regret the doing of it. Back in Deadwood, Calamity finds herself suddenly the babe in the woods as she becomes mired in a love quadrangle. See, Calamity had long fancied this Army lieutenant (Philip Carey), although he'd always been oblivious of her interest. Katie Brown's arrival ignites a rivalry between him and Wild Bill Hickok (Howard Keel), with Calamity trying to shoehorn her way in.1953's CALAMITY JANE chugs along on high spirits and broad comedy and exuberant musical numbers. It's interesting to see Doris Day stray some from her trademark girl-next-door appeal. She interprets Calamity as a tomboy taken to the extreme and woefully out of her depth when it comes to courtin' and elocution and, probably, baths. I liked it, liked her comedic timing and her moments of vulnerability and, of course, her singing. Secret Love is the most celebrated song to come out of this movie, but I'm most fond of The Black Hills of Dakota, which is primarily a duet between Day and Howard Keel. I'm also partial to My Heart Is Higher Than a Hawk (Deeper Than a Well) which allows Keel to exercise his awesome baritone. And who doesn't love The Deadwood Stage? Whip-Crack-Away!Odds are, events in Calamity's boisterous life didn't go down like this... Or maybe it did. Cold hard facts are hard to come by when it comes to her. But I like this version of Calamity Jane. And if I had to live in Deadwood, I prefer that it be this version of Deadwood and not the town in that HBO show. #%$! that! So, yeah, watch this movie. It's cleaner than this review.\",\n",
              "       \"It's like a nightmare out of Kafka: everything you can remember is false, and everything you think you know about your life is a lie. Such is the dilemma at the heart of Total Recall, which also has the honor of being one of the best movies Arnold Schwarzenegger has ever made. A lot of this comes from the plot, which is full of memorable twists and clever plotting -- not to mention the glorious depiction of a futuristic Mars.Every night, Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger) is haunted by a dream of Mars and a strange woman (Rachel Ticotin). He even wants to visit Mars, but his wife Lori (Sharon Stone) is reluctant. After all, Mars is going through a nasty rebellion at the moment. On impulse, Quaid decides to go to Rekall, a company that implants false memories for entertainment, and selects a secret agent fantasy on Mars.But things instantly go very wrong when he has a convulsive reaction, and ends up dumped in a taxi. As he tries to get home, his coworkers all try to kill him -- and at home, Lori also tries to murder him, revealing that their entire marriage is a false memory.Quaid goes on the run, with only a cryptic message from his former self to guide him. But even if he can get to Mars and avoid being captured by Lori and the cops, he has to find the mysterious Melina (who turns out to be the lady from his dream). And as he seeks out the mysterious leader of the Resistance, Quaid finds that there may be things in his past he doesn't want to remember...Total Recall doesn't stick very closely to Philip K. Dick's original story, but it doesn't shame it either. The story is delightfully unpredictable from beginning to end -- while you might be able to figure out quickly that Quaid is remembering lost memories of Mars, most of the plot twists after that are genuinely shocking. And underlying everything is the haunting question: Is any of this real?This is Paul Verhoeven back when he was good, and Total Recall displays him at his best -- lots of action-packed fight scenes, gruesomeness (the removal of the tracker up Arnold's nose is especially gross), and an underlying current of humor that keeps things from ever getting too grim ( If things have gone wrong, I'm talking to myself and you don't have a wet towel around your head).And lest anyone forget it's a sci-fi movie, most of the action takes place on a delightfully sleazy Mars colony where mutants walk amongst the normal humans. Example: Quaid speaks to a three-breasted hooker at a bar. And there's a subplot about a mysterious set of alien machines that only comes to fruition late in the story.Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of those actors that is normally pretty mediocre, but is amazing when he's got a good script and direction. He overflows with humor and charisma in this role (Consider that a divorce!) and he has excellent chemistry with Ticotin. This is a hero you can actually root for, but we're also constantly reminded that we don't know the real man.Total Recall is a like taking a rollercoaster ride, with lots of wild action and thrills -- as well as one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best performances ever. Definitely worth watching.\",\n",
              "       \"Any scene in Stephen King's It that features Tim Curry as the evil, shape-shifting clown Pennywise is sublimely scary--particularly his first appearance, which will make you jump out of your seat. The rest of it, unfortunately, is a standard-issue TV-movie, not bad but not distinguished or even particularly frightening. Richard Thomas and John Ritter give decent performances, and Richard Masur makes the most of his few gory minutes on screen. But the other adult actors get annoying after a while, and the ending is frankly lame compared with the scenes of Pennywise. Of the child actors, the best by far is Jonathan Brandis, playing Richard Thomas' character as a child. It is unbearably sad to think that Brandis hanged himself a dozen or so years later, just as it is unbearable to think of River Phoenix's fate after seeing Stand By Me.The plot of It bears a definite resemblance to that of Stand By Me--particularly the themes of the vicious teenage gang threatening the smart, nerdy kids and tne general lack of empathy among the adults. 'It introduces the idea that Pennywise's influence has made the whole town mean, but it doesn't develop that theme. I have no idea whether King developed it more in the book, but I can't help but notice that the Maine townspeople in King's books tend to be cold and cruel in general, much like the nasty New Englanders in Shirley Jackson's books. I don't know if King can be accused of stealing from Jackson on that count, but between the stories of those two, it sure doesn't make me want to visit New England!The extras on the DVDs are sparse, consisting only of commentary by the director, Tommy Lee Wallace, and the cast.

She's friendlier, more encouraging to have a summer with nonstop fun and excitement, and welcomes the campers in a more deceiving kind of way where you'd never guess she's the one responsible for their eventual deaths.  Heck, if I met her, she'd even be able to trick *me* into thinking she's actually a believable happy go lucky camper!  It's just hilarious the way Pamela's character seems obsessed with the good-hearted outdoor lifestyle of nature and camping, only to end up killing the ones that fornicate, enjoy drugs and drinking, and have filthy swearing mouths.In Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers, Pamela Springsteen's especially gruesome.  For me, when it comes to horror it has to come down to how awesome and creative the actual murders are, and the ones in this film are probably better than the ones in the first and third Sleepaway Camp movies.  A horror movie simply needs to show viewers all the unique ways to murder people despite how vicious, raw and compassionless they may seem.I absolutely LOVE the one where the sassy blonde-haired cheerleader type gets stabbed in the back by a knife and then shoved down a poopy, fly-infested toilet in the outhouse.  Just a beautiful conclusion for such a disrespectable person.  Of course there's always that one girl that the bad guy doesn't really *want* to kill so she's always the last one to die (or become the hero) and the girl who plays this role does a magnificent job in that regard.  She doesn't want to kill Pamela until she reaches that point where she's forced to defend herself.This movie truthfully has more nudity and sex than the other ones in the series.  Lots of breasts and sexual segments.  Hey no *wonder* Pamela Springsteen is exceptionally murderous this time around, haha.  Of course the low budget acting and poorly exeucted smacks and clobbers of sticks knocking people to the ground have remained.  These segments are forgiveable in this case however, because it's hilarious how obvious these characters aren't getting anywhere *close* to taking a hit in the film but yet, they play like it was a devastating blow, haha.  Gotta love it!  Really bad, but, a trademark of sorts for the Sleepaway Camp series.Overall, highly recommend to all horror lovers.\",\n",

And they do a great job.  To be honest, most of the film made me chuckle with only a few hard, out right, laughing aloud moments.  Still, the special effects, when used, are great and the settings, costumes, and music are all done well, with a lot of skill and LOVE.  You can tell they enjoyed making this film while at the same time being serious and, I would say, even respectable towards the source, the original movie of Dracula.  If you have to pick between a Twilight movie or this one - get this one.  A PG-13, with some gore, it is a perfect 90 minute film for a pizza night.  Maybe not for the little ones but young teens could watch it without the parents feeling too uncomfortable.  Has commentary also, which was pretty nice.',\n",

Without the kind of galactic-sized budget or recklessly eccentric touches that would come to define the series in later installments, I was impressed with the film's ingenuity in filling those holes. Though Bond lacks his usual cache of gimmicks and gadgets, that time is instead spent inspecting the finer points of his espionage work, which I appreciated. There's something to be said for firing lasers from a pocket watch, but I was just as captivated watching Sean Connery booby trap his closet with a single strand of hair or set up a would-be assassin by rolling his bedsheets into a bundle and laying in wait. It loses touch with that grounded sensibility in the third act, though, which is much more in-line with what one would expect from the series. Bond's dastardly eponymous foil is comically run-of-the-mill, although he doesn't truly get enough screen time to explain himself and seems far too easily defeated. This is such a Connery showcase, though, that I doubt there'd have been room for such elaborations to stick anyway.\",\n",

Vengence and retribution get pushed aside for a smoochie country picnic and some needless love interest. Somebody must have thought Clint needed a girl friend after finishing up the Leone trilogy. Wish L.Q. would have returned to finish up his earlier botched assassination attempt during this picnic sequence. Besides, this romantic interlude brought the film to a deadly halt with an impact equal of Reno getting blasted in the saloon, though not nearly as rewarding or as satisfying.Now I've got nothing against women (in general) in Westerns. Women often add much to the overall story, like splashing around in a wine vat in THE WILD BUNCH. But Inger's scenes here are a complete waste. I repeat, this would have been a far better Western had they cut her obligatory love-interest role and spent the time far more wisely by having Clint track down the last two guys instead. Whether he brought them back dead or alive, no matter. It certainly would have made more interesting viewing.Excellent dvd, looks and sounds just great. Lots of familiar faces too; Ben Johnson, L.Q. Jones, Bruce Dern and even old-time Cowboy Hero Bob Steele! HANG EM HIGH belongs in all Western collections.\",\n",

The exaggerated uniforms of the military bring a snicker every time I see the DPRK's big hats. The movie's proximity to the vaudeville era explains its occasional outbursts of song, keeping that tradition from fading.And, it's still safe for kids. Finding kid-safe movies that still hold the grownups has become a painful and nearly futile search, to the detriment of kids and grownups alike.

              "       \"Less Sci-Fi, more horror, Event Horizon liberally borrows from many filmmakers to create an unsettling exercise in the art of cut and paste.  It is and it isn't a lot of things.  Call it a haunted house in space, call it a vengeful vessel of doom, call it a pig in a poke; it is all that and so much less.  The plot involves gathering `bodies' in one location, trapping them there, then picking them off one by one till few are left to tell the tale.  It's an overused plot device that others have turned into a viewing-goldmine.  In this interpretation however, all they managed to mine was tin.  But.  Even recognizing this as a just another pale copy of better films, there's something about it that I respond to (maybe its familiarity?).  Or, admitting that I'm more of a fan of horror than Sci-Fi; I do love things that go bump in the night or pound on a (metal) door, causing dents.  Then too, the cast is fabulous, especially Kathleen Quinlan, Joely Richardson, Sean Pertwee, and Laurence Fishburne.  Apparently, there was a stronger version of this film, heavily edited before its dismal release (it was a box office flop).  I'm not surprised it failed to grab fans initially; this must have been a nightmare to market.  A conceptual `monster' is a lot harder to promote than a thing we can see and respond to.  Turning Sam Neill (Dr. Weir) into that `thing,' late in the game, only confused matters (was he real, was he a ghost, was he some dimensional creature/creation, was he a literal manifestation of whatever haunted the vessel Event Horizon, or was he something `borrowed' from Clive Barker?).  This movie is like a rough draft with loads of potential.  I'd like to see the original unedited version but I don't suppose that will ever happen.\",\n",

That isn't a negative, really, as the director was still clearly in his prime, but it does fit quite snugly next to the other family-friendly adventure flicks in his portfolio in that it's big and intense without going so far over-the-top as to scare the kiddos. Of course, at the time the real star here was the film's fantastic effects work - it was CGI's coming out party, after all - and that aspect has aged surprisingly well over the past two decades. Sure, if we look closely a few seams might show here or there, but the raptors remain unsettlingly vivid and our first glimpses of a grazing brachiosaurus remain nothing short of stunning.

His advice seems to be that all we can do is get used to not knowing why the world is the way it is or why things happen the way they do.All religion, (or art), has to offer are stories of other people's confusions that momentarily divert us from our own.Larry Gopnik is happiest. most at ease, when he climbs up on his roof, adjusts his perceptual antenna, and allows himself to be diverted from his own life (by his sexy neighbor who sunbathes in the nude and who seems to live in a perpetual state of distraction aided by pop culture and recreational drugs).That is all, the Coen Bros seem to be saying in this film that is a culmination and reflection upon their life's work thus far, that we can offer you.Last scene (spoiler alert): I think the phone call that comes right after Larry Gopnik changes Clive's grade to a C-(which I love) could be interpreted to mean that there is order in the universe after all, and that everyone gets whats coming to them, but if the phone call means cancer and if the tornado touching down is meant to be the hand of God come down to take Larry's son, well thats a pretty harsh set of punishments for giving Clive a C-.Given the choice between living in a random or indifferent universe without any ultimate order and living in a cruel universe that is ordered by a strict disciplinarian, I think most people would take the random or indifferent universe.\",\n",

Indy is such a fascinating, larger-than-life personality that he outright demands our attention when he's on the screen (which is something like 95% of the time) and, even when we think we've got him figured out, still manages to surprise us. Casting Harrison Ford was absolutely crucial, though, because without his off-the-chart levels of confidence and charisma, the character wouldn't have been able to get away with half the things he does or says. Although it trots the globe, seemingly without rest, the plot is actually very well-paced and wisely gives the cold shoulder to any hint of overwrought back-story or origin. We're having enough fun in the present, so why get caught up in anything more complicated than He's a professor who moonlights as a tomb raider? Quick-witted and funny when appropriate, exciting and unpredictable the rest of the time, it manages a near-perfect blend of realism and fantasy.

Daniel Day-Lewis is astonishing and hilarious here (there are a couple of shocking moments of violence, but nothing too extreme--I thought Goodfellas was way more violent than this), and I think that his fabricated Bill the Butcher character is one of the classics of modern cinema. If you can imagine a petulant combination of Groucho Marx and Wild Bill Hickok speaking a New York American accent and having an absurdly graceful talent with throwing sharp knives, then you can imagine Day-Lewis's thoroughly authentic and inspired character. DeCaprio might be miscast here (as the Amazon reviewer mentions) but I for one think he is pretty damn good. Gangs of New York is a revenge story and there is some roughhousing here, but I enjoyed it over all, and I think Scorsese is having a field day here, so to speak. This is definitely an American film in every sense, and I liked it a lot. The period detail is great really, and although Scorsese employs some dubious CGI shots along the way, I still like his love letter to old New York. There are so many cinematic references in Scorsese's movies that watching them can be like a textbook reading if you really know your cinema history, but Gangs of New York is so full of enthusiasm, action, nasty dialogue (from the Butcher, who else?) and graceful cinematography that its pure cinematic scope allows one to sink into its atmosphere with ease.

This early lesser masterpiece is no different.  I label it a `lesser' masterpiece because it lacks the dynamic nature of films like `8 ' and `La Dolce Vita' but still maintains the earnest honesty that his films are synonymous with.In `I Vitelloni' we are introduced to five friends with varying degrees of laziness that dwell in an Italian neighborhood where their slacking nature is being driven to an end by the imposing walls of life.  Fausto knocked up Moraldo's sister and attempts to leave town but is forced to marry her and take up a job at a local religious gift shop.  Fausto's philandering ways are a problem though and threaten to derail his marriage and his life henceforth.  Alberto is struggling to keep peace in his home as he battles with his adulterous sister as she pursues a relationship with a married man.  Moraldo is trying to keep his friends in line, but especially reel in his new brother-in-law, and Leopold (and aspiring writer) and Riccardo (a talented singer) try to keep up with their feisty friends.While at times the film can feel scattered, it all comes together in such an organic way, and these characters are all given so much light (although Alberto and Fausto are certainly the more developed characters).  Alberto Sordi is sensational as the deeply affected Alberto, and Franco Fabrizi anchors this film in such a suavely unlikable way as the complicated Fausto.The technical aspects are all well placed, with a rapturous score and delightful cinematography, but it is Felini's direction and grasp of the material that makes this film so special.

While I enjoyed the intrigue and the riddles behind the engravings found in The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows, I didn't care for the ambiguity I felt when the credits rolled up. Polanski has left a few obvious questions unanswered, and based on some of the reviews I've read here, I'm not alone in this boat.SPOILER ALERT:To break through my confusion, I had to watch the DVD a few times and read the screenplay. I'm not going to state that I understand the minutiae of TNG, but I think where I'm at in understanding the movie, it's good enough for me.One big question mark for me and many others was the identity of The Girl with blond hair. Was she The Whore of Babylon as some have claimed, or a witch in league with the Devil? Based on clues I've dug up mostly in the script and what I saw in the film, I'm convinced she is the Devil.Another unanswered question had to do with Andrew Telfer's suicide. Why did he hang himself? Polanski provides a not-so-obvious clue by using the character of Baroness Kessler to state, If he ever finds out what his wife gets up to in these gatherings, he'll probably kill himself. Moreover, it's my opinion Telfer found out his wife only married him for his money and to further her Satanic pursuits.There's more but I won't go into it in this review. Half the fun of watching the movie is in trying to figure out what's happening. And that's what Polanski wants you to do.

Yet, alas, based on the recent boating adventures that placed Ms. Brockovich in some legal peril, perhaps she's not quite as intelligent as the movie suggests.  But I digress.When we meet Erin Brockovich in the film, she is a bombshell single mom down on her luck--a woman absolutely fearless to wear tight, suggestive--very revealing--outfits.  When her auto injury lawsuit gets thrown out, she bullies her way into a job at the firm of the lawyer who represented her (Albert Finney, a curmudgeon to my liking).  But what's she going to do?

There are the (predictable) setbacks, and all the while Erin's personal life is put in serious strain, yet in the end there is a poignant feel good moment, augmented by a fiery Erin getting her long overdue comeuppance once she receives her bonus check from Finney's gloating character.This is my favorite Julia Roberts role (to be honest, there's not much competition); the actress aptly carries the freight the entire story.  Finney more than holds his own, and the chemistry with Roberts is exceptional.  Special kudos to Aaron Eckhart as the free spirit, shaggy, next door neighbor biker who ends up babysitting Erin's three kids on a full-time basis; Eckhart's character is the soothing balm that keeps Erin's life from spinning out of control.

              "       \"Richard Linklater is the master of the conversation film.  From his first movie, Slacker, to his more recent creation, Bernie, he has always relied on dialogue to carry his narrative.  For some this is a weakness.  Film is a visual medium, after all.  Linklater's films may not be as visually striking as other auteurs, but in subduing the visual element, he has refocused his narratives on the intimate, often mundane conversations that take place between his characters.  Nowhere in his filmography is this more apparent than Before Sunrise, a romantic film about two couples who meet in Vienna, strike up a half a day's worth of a relationship, and, of course, madly fall in love.The two protagonists of Before Sunrise, Celine and Jessie, first meet on a train as it's pulling into Vienna.  Celine has switched seats to get out of earshot of a bickering couple, and the two strike up a conversation that's unnaturally cut short because Jessie is flying out of Europe tomorrow and Celine is supposed to continue on the train ride.  Both characters are twenty-somethings who are away from home--Jessie is American and Celine is French--but they are well suited conversationalists.  Before getting off the train, Jessie decides to offer Celine an opportunity to spend more time together.  He doesn't have any extra money, so he was planning on just walking around the city all day and all night until it is time to head to the airport, and he thinks it would be a lot more enjoyable with Celine's company. After a brief hesitation, Celine agrees, and the rest of the film consists of the two characters casually wondering around Vienna engaging in a series of conversations, some personal, some profound, and others overly extravagant.From there the plot doesn't get any more complicated.  While each character has his or her own unique disappointments in life, there are no huge reveals, no life defining moment that explains who they are or why they are on this journey.  Both are smart, literate, and liberal, but where Jessie is somewhat of a cynic, Celine has a bit of a radical streak.  In most romantic films there is some contrived event that prevents the two characters from getting together.  There's nothing so obvious in Before Sunrise, but Jessie and Celine do fight against their own disappointments in the world.  Watching their parents and others who have weathered life, they have realized that there are no happy endings.  If there's anything that keeps these two characters apart, it's the realization that what they have cultivated over the course of a night in Vienna cannot last.  Their relationship, as it exists now, has an expiration date.  For most of the film, they are guarded, afraid of really falling for each other.In something of a surprise, Before Sunrise produced two sequels (and Jessie and Celine made cameo appearances in Richard Linklater's film, Waking Life).  After watching Before Sunrise yet again, this makes a lot more sense than you might think.  Throughout the film, Jessie and Celine discuss ways in which family and profession, perception and reality whittle down our idealized romantic notions.  At one point, Jessie says, It's just, people have these romantic projections they put on everything that's not based on any kind of reality.  And it is, after all, a bickering married couple that causes Celine to change seats and meet Jessie in the first place.  Both characters are aware that they may very well become that couple.  In this sense the ending where both Jessie and Celine agree to meet at the same place in six months might have stood as a beautiful cop out.  The ambiguity allows us to envision what might happen in their future without fully exploring these implications.  To Linklater's credit, he decided to do the impossible and find out where these characters are nine years down the road.  As Celine says at one point, It's like some kind of sociological experiment.\",\n",

There is an even tone throughout.On another note,  watch the original Traffik which was a German TV mini-series.  It is superb and more gritty.  I thought it was terrific.  Many scenes from Traffik were lifted into the Soderbergh film.I was the producer of a documentary called American Federale which deals with an American Citizen who became a Mexican Federale policeman - and had to juggle the cartels, his everyday life and legitimate police work in the process.  It's up on Amazon now and is an insightful gaze into this world.  Lobo is the cop (we don't use his real name) and has stories that he can tell.  And ones that he can't tell on video or over the phone.  If you watch traffic, then you'll like the grounded documentary.\",\n",

Jack Benny (who I never had much time for) is perfectly cast as the actor who rises to the occasion; Lombard was never lovelier and rarely funnier; and Robert Stack (one of the great underrated actors) didn't get to do anything this funny again until Airplane -- almost forty years later.It's lots of goofy-action, making fun of the Nazis, some nice set pieces (the irony of having a spy hunted by poles dressed as Nazis), some dark humor (Benny puts the local Gestapo chief on the spot when he names what he claims are Nazi agents, only to discover they have been inadvertently shot), and a screw-ball romance threading it all together.But the danger with satire -- even satire this clever -- is that real life can quickly eclipse it.  This, unfortunately, is exactly what happened to To Be Or Not To Be:In 1943 the Nazi's crushed the ghetto uprising, capturing or killing more than 50,000 Jews.  In 1944, while the Red Army watched from across the river, another 150,000-200,000 Poles were killed in the Warsaw uprising.

If nature, is it due to an anti-nature, the possession by some sort of primal malevolent spirit, such as proposed by the great and too seldom seen movie Fast Runner (enthusiastically endorsed by the late Siskel and Ebert)?In 'White Ribbon', 'Something Evil This Way Comes' came early in the 20th Century to an unsuspecting Germany.  Future Nazis demonstrate their spiritual sickness and psychopathology as children in a series of vile acts; acts that pass the boundary between over-zealous juvenile delinquency and wanton depraved mind criminality.  Parents troubled by their children's horrible behavior and lack of empathy precede a world later stunned by that same defect, a defect of soul and psyche that ultimately manifested itself in a global crime spree of a magnitude never seen before or since.'White Ribbon' is not only an entertaining and well-made movie, but also an essential and unique historical proposition in the sense that it prods its viewers to consider a possible explanation for an otherwise inexplicable evil.\",\n",

              "       \"The combination of disgust and exasperation with which Rosalind Russell as Auntie Mame drily delivers the above quip to her nephew's vapid prejudiced fianc&eacute;e is a source of never ending delight.  Ms. Russell gave many noteworthy performances for which she is remembered in The Women, His Girl Friday, My Sister Eileen and The Trouble With Angels among others, but Auntie Mame is her signature role, one that she had originated on Broadway to rave reviews. This role was the culmination of a distinguished career and reveals every facet of her brilliance as she runs the gamut from laughs to tears.  Auntie Mame is one of the true feel good films, guaranteed to lift your spirits if you're feeling low.  There is also a lovely, festive, holiday air about it, in the last several years Turner Classic Movies has been screening it on either Christmas Eve or early Christmas morning, very apropos!The story of Auntie Mame I believe is probably well known by almost everyone, but here's the plot in a nutshell.  It's 1929, and the orphaned ten year old Patrick Dennis (Jan Handzlik) accompanied by his nursemaid Norah Muldoon (Connie Gilchrist) arrives at the Beekman Place apartment in Manhattan of his only living relative his Auntie Mame Dennis (Rosalind Russell).  Auntie Mame is an exuberant free spirit who embraces all the many possibilities of life with &eacute;lan and panache.  She has a wide circle of exotic friends and acquaintances ranging from the dapper publisher Lindsay Woolsey (Patric Knowles), her sometime beau to her best friend the acerbic renowned stage actress Vera Charles (Coral Browne).  Mame falls in love with Patrick at first glimpse, and showers the little boy with affection. She is determined to raise Patrick to live life to the fullest, or to she aptly puts it Life is a banquet, and most poor suckers are starving to death!  However Patrick's stuffy trustee of his late father's estate, the banker Dwight Babcock (Fred Clark) horrified by Mame's unconventionality is determined to rein her in and make sure Patrick has a conservative education and proper lifestyle.  So the battle is enjoined for Patrick's upbringing and molding his character, although there will be some bumps along the way guess who will triumph?From the first ebullient notes of the musical score as the film begins, through the creative opening titles  where the bejeweled red gloved arm of Auntie Mame presents a kaleidoscope to the viewer's eye, where the shimmering crystals spell out Rosalind Russell as Auntie Mame, this is a veritable cornocopia of riches.  It's a merry romp from beginning to end as we are swept along with Patrick by the beguiling, blithe Auntie Mame in a sparkling screenplay courtesy of the expert team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green adapting the hit play by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee.  The production is gleaming, splashy and extravagant as becomes its heroine, with production design and art direction by Malcolm C. Bert, which is especially inspired in the ever changing d&eacute;cor of Mame's Beekman Place digs.  Veteran Warner Brothers costume designer Orry Kelly designed a wardrobe for Auntie Mame that is a vivid mating of the chic and outr&eacute; that Rosalind Russell's tall, slender figure wears with a sweeping, elegant flair. The original stage director Morton DaCosta deftly transferred the Broadway smash hit to a Technicolor wide screen blockbuster that was nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture of 1958, but lost to GiGi.I do want to acknowledge the author Patrick Dennis who wrote the original novel entitled, what else, Auntie Mame.  Even though he was rejected by I believe nineteen publishers he refused to be defeated.  The result a red hot best seller that spawned a hit play, film, and musical.  He also contributed a phrase to the English language, if you call someone an Auntie Mame, many people will understand the reference.Before I discuss the actors, a very quick word about the extras, slim pickings I'm afraid. The trailer for the film, and also for the vastly inferior musical remake Mame  There is an option where the viewer can listen just to the musical score by composer Bronislau Kaper, which is jaunty, quirky and tender just like Auntie Mame itself, and helps enrich the film.  However that's pretty much it, unfortunately most of the people connected with film had already passed away when the DVD came out, so a commentary was out of consideration.The supporting cast is wonderful, with Jan Handzlik as young Patrick, Peggy Cass as the dowdy secretary Agnes Gooch, and Yuki Shimoda as Mame's Japanese houseboy Ito, in addition to Ms. Russell repeating their Broadway roles.  Cass is especially droll as Agnes who Mame transforms into a butterfly for one night with unforeseen results; she got tapped with a Best Supporting Actress nomination.  Patric Knowles, Forrest Tucker and Robin Hughes as the men in Mame's life all good, as is Roger Smith as the grown up Patrick.  Fred Clark as the pompous Babcock, Lee Patrick and Willard Waterman as the social climbing, pretentious Upsons are appallingly right on target, as is Joanna Barnes as the shallow Gloria Upson with her dreadful Larchmont Lockjaw accent. Watch for her story about the ping pong ball!  Kudos as well to Pippa Scott as Pegeen Ryan, and Connie Gilchrist as Norah.  However the most creative piece of casting is Coral Browne as the veddy British actress Vera Charles who has a definite fondness for the bottle.  She's impeccable, I love her groaning at the afternoon sun as struggling with a hangover she peers out a window Oh, that moon's bright! Russell and she play off each other matchlessly in their scenes together, like two tennis champions.  Her Vera is svelte, worldly, and a sure mistress of the curdled rejoinder, a peerless foil for Mame! By rights, Ms. Browne should have gotten a Supporting Actress nomination as well.However, let's not kid ourselves; Rosalind Russell is the ultimate reason for the film's success.  She dominates the movie from our first introduction to Auntie Mame's nimbly darting down her staircase, her cape flying out behind her to her ascending it regally at the movie's end.  Ms. Russell's Auntie Mame is a definite force of nature, a glorious whirling dervish, warm, wacky and wondrous.  Yes, she's glittering, flamboyant and eccentric, scatterbrained at times yet shrewdly wise but there is never a doubt of her love and caring for Patrick.  An early scene that demonstrates this is when Patrick falls asleep on Mame's chaise lounge in her bedroom on his first night, and Mame tenderly covers him with her cape, then drapes her mink coat over him as well.  Angela Lansbury brought the same dazzling radiance in the Broadway musical Mame, but regrettably a too old, chilly, raspy voiced Lucille Ball did the poor movie version.  Never fear though, Rosalind Russell's Auntie Mame is the definitive portrayal, the one for the ages.  She had gotten a Tony nomination for Best Actress in 1956 when the play opened on Broadway, and was deservedly acknowledged with a Best Actress Oscar nomination as well. Although she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical, the Academy Award sadly eluded her. I'd like to close with a quote from LIFE magazine when Auntie Mame opened on Broadway in 1956. But it is Roz herself who makes Auntie Mame a saint in spite of her sins, and one of the most unforgettable characters of the modern American stage.\",\n",

It is rare to see a film tackle such complex emotions without wearing every one of them on its sleeve.  Yes, there are tense moments and there are emotional outbursts and breakdowns and yet there is not a false note here, not a moment that feels overdone for the sake of `emoting'.`Fearless' tells the story of Max Klein, a man who stares his own death in the face as the plane he is on is hurtled towards the ground.  Internally grounded, Max offers assistance to the other passengers, helping them to relax into the situation, and then after he survives the crash he lends a helping hand to those escaping the craft.  Despite his seeming levelheadedness, Max's life is forever changed by the situation and this seeps into his home life as he tries to get back into the swing of things.  He alienates his wife and begins to draw ever closer to a fellow survivor, Carla, who is suffering emotional distress over the loss of her infant son.Peter Weir directs this film with a restraint that I find so becoming.  He completely understands how to sell the film without overselling it.  He pulls back in all the right moments (the film possesses an eerie sense of quiet) and then allows his actors, especially the Oscar nominated Rosie Perez, to explore the more dramatic scope of their character's suffering.  At the end of the day, `Fearless' is an astute observation on the effect certain events can have on our lives.  From a subliminal standpoint, Max is racked with a feeling is doesn't understand and it manifests itself in isolating ways.  The cast is exceptional here, with Bridges perfecting his take on the emotionally distraught and Isabella Rossellini doing some of her best work as Max's wife.Highly recommended for anyone seeking out a film that goes for the realistic over the obvious.\",\n",

Although my own childhood was long gone by the time this hit theaters, watching it today was like leaping back through time to an age filled with innocence and wonder. That effect does occasionally get lathered on a bit thick, but a speedy pace and densely populated realm are usually enough to compensate for such moments. JK Rowling's rich, sprawling, imaginative world is downright hypnotizing on the screen, loaded with treats and treasures, and it's tough to look away for even an instant. Although the CGI work is distractingly bad in a few instances (it very nearly ruins the Quidditch match), the child actors are average at best and there isn't much adversity to our heroes' hunt for the MacGuffin Stone, it's still a cheery, entertaining introduction to a universe that's positively buzzing with potential.\",\n",

Loosely based on two H.P. Lovecraft works, a 2001 Spanish horror film may disappoint the author's fans, but as a slick B-horror flick Dagon manages to deliver the goods.Directed by Stuart Gordon of Re-Animator fame, the story of Dagon revolves around a young billionaire Paul Marsh (Ezra Godden) having a vacation with his girlfriend Barbara (Raquel Mero&ntilde;o) in Spain on their friend's boat. When a storm arrives, they head for a nearby seaside village Imboca, where he is attacked by a group of strange-looking residents.Set in modern-day Spain, this is not a very faithful Lovecraft adaptation, but still is a surprisingly enjoyable ride. Acting is at best so-so, though I found Macarena G&oacute;mez's dream girl pretty impressive. Also, I wanted to see more people with the Innsmouth look, and was not much impressed with the protagonist's one-liners, but except the weak (and thankfully brief) introduction, the film maintains the creepy atmosphere.Dagon is a decent horror movie that is entertaining, but also makes us want to see a more authentic version of The Shadow Over Innsmouth set in Massachusetts, and hopefully with a bus.\",\n",

But they're already rich and famous--they just don't know it.  Joining a fourth man who has just sold his soul to the devil to play the guitar, they record Man of Constant Sorrow in a cracker box studio, calling themselves the Soggy Bottom Boys; the tune becomes a statewide sensation.  Yet Ulysses and his group are constantly on the run, primarily from prison guards intent on inflicting their own vigilante justice; en route the runaways encounter just about everything, from seductive sirens to a one-eyed con. . .even a choreographed Klan rally.  Yet as this delightful film comes to its climax, we learn the real reason Ulysses wants to escape from prison.George Clooney is sensational as Ulysses Everett McGill, a smooth-talking persuader with a weakness for Dapper Dan pomade (no doubt a tongue-in-cheek spoof to Clooney himself). But even better are John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as Pete and Delmar, the fellow cons who escape with Ulysses.  Both sport enough clueless facial expressions and thick hick twang to make Hee Haw look like Masterpiece Theater.  John Goodman, always remarkably good, has a brief role as a one-eyed Bible salesman--a salesman with other intentions up his sleeve.  And the rest of the cast more than holds its own.  But the real stars of O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? are the imaginative Coens, who through their images and music and settings serve us up a slice of Down South Americana.

              "       \"The chorus of valiant defenders of Scorsese's VERY controversial retelling of the days of Christ is bound to get heated when the see my review.  I can't help it, I hate this movie.  Now, I'm not merely coming at this from the `tyrannical Christian' point of view, but one cannot help but become stirred when seeing such a tactless interpretation of Christ's life and ministry.  Maybe this is a tad harsh, but for me there are certain aspects of scripture that shouldn't be tampered with in such a strong way, and Christ is an entity who demands respect and admiration and really shouldn't be contorted to fit an artist's idea of what religion stands for.  There are plenty of other earthly men in the scriptures who battled with their own self-doubt and interpreting their struggles accordingly would have been fine, but taking on this alternate account of Christ comes across uncomfortable and insulting.No, I do not think you are a heathen if you watch this movie or even love this movie.  It is all about personal opinion and personal reactions, and my personal reaction was one of disgust.But, like I said, this is not merely from a strictly religious point of view.  As far as the remaining aspects of the film, I find little merit.  The main performances within the film carry little depth, especially Keitel's depiction of Judas as a `GoodFella'.  His thuggish approach (complete with Brooklyn accent) strips away the internal conflictions Judas should have been saddled with and made him a mere one-note antagonist.  This is a real shame, since Judas, whether in this alternate reality or in the real one, is a VERY intriguing and complex character.  Willem Dafoe doesn't fare any better really.  He makes Christ appear so scattered and confused that he loses all aspects of mightiness and simply comes off like a man deranged.  Maybe this was the point, but if it was then it loses all credibility and becomes a pointless narrative.Why be concerned with these conflictions if they are not truly depicted in the body of Christ?  I mean, isn't the whole draw of this film to find the `humanness' in Christ?  If that `human' resembles nothing of Christ, then where is your movie?The film is beautifully shot, the score is haunting, and Scorsese has a knack for creating intriguing atmospheres that linger from frame to frame, but the story feels redundant in parts, uninteresting in many and blasphemous throughout.\",\n",

I am becoming more and more acquainted with his work with each passing year, and while I stand on the fence with his collective body of work, there is no denying that he can weave a crazy tale like no one else.  His soap opera tendencies serve to either aid or hinder his films, depending on the narrative and his use of restraint, but at the end of the day when he gets it right he gets it VERY right.`Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown' is a moment when he got it very right.Thrusting us into the lives of multiple women, all contending with various issues regarding men, Almodovar paints a colorful and flourishing picture of bickering, pleading, plotting and reminiscing all with surging splashing of charm, wit and loads of soap!Pepa is an actress in love with a married man.  That married man has been separated from his wife for some time, and now he is walking out on Pepa.

When Pepa's best friend shows up with her own set of man problems (this time involving the cops), Pepa's place is turned into a circus complete with drugged gazpacho and loaded guns.Almodovar doesn't hold back here, but the film really called for such lavish helpings of `over the top'.  It benefits from an outlandish atmosphere because the narrative is just that farfetched.  It thrives.  The cast is uniformly great, with Carmen Maura and Julieta Serrano taking `best in show' notices from me.If you are new to the world of Almodovar, then check this one out.

              "       \"Despite a couple of high-profile stars in Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, James Mangold's long-gestating version of Elmore Leonard's 3:10 to Yuma wasn't able to do a True Grit at the box-office and provide a western hit, which is a pity because it's the best effort to revive the horse opera since Open Range. Perhaps the original intended casting of Tom Cruise and Eric Bana may have helped at the box-office - Crowe certainly doesn't have even half of the charisma that Glenn Ford had in the 1957 Delmar Daves version, though Bale has suffering down almost as pat as the eternally worn-down Van Heflin - but the film surprisingly manages to improve on that version's problematic ending that stopped it just short of being a masterpiece: it's not a huge change, but it's just big enough for one character's actions to make sense this time and not feel like a Hollywood copout. It's not the only difference. The short story has been opened out considerably, no longer relegating much of the action to a two-hander in a hotel room as the very bad man and his unlikely escort wait for the prison train - or for his ruthless gang to try to spring him. This time round more than half of the picture is taken up with the eventful ride to that town through Apache territory and a railroad camp with Ben Foster and the remnants of the gang in hot pursuit of the ever-depleting makeshift group of guards - Peter Fonda's ruthless and convincingly weather-beaten bounty hunter, Alan Tudyk's vet, Dallas Roberts' railroad man and Bale's embittered son Logan Lerman.Mangold's Copland was very much a modern-day Western and he's completely at home with the real thing, offering another disabled hero nobody thinks is up to the job in Christian Bale's embattled debt-saddled rancher who had his foot shot off back in the wars and is now desperate for cash to prevent the local loan shark from burning down his farm and selling it to the railroad. It does a better job of linking the two men than the earlier version, with Bale stumbling across their gold shipment robbery while searching for his scattered herd. The robbery itself sets the tone for the new version and its considerably larger body count and the odd trailer-friendly explosion, and also gives unwelcome rise to Crowe explaining one particularly ruthless action that would have been better left unjustified, though thankfully there's not too much expounding of world views or moral codes. Like the best Westerns, this is a film where actions speak louder than words, and the action itself is generally well handled, the screenplay throwing in some good twists along the way even if Crowe's outlaw never really gets under Bale's skin the way that Ford managed with Heflin. It's well acted too, the supporting players making their mark without hogging the screen and Mangold keeping things moving along briskly despite the running time passing the two hour mark. Like the Delmar Daves version this may not make it to the very top tier of the genre, but it's still a damn good - and damn entertaining - Western.The DVD includes an audio commentary by Mangold, 7 deleted scenes, only one, where Crowe's outlaw taunts Bale by telling his son isn't protecting you, he's following me, adding much, and a trio of featurettes, but the BluRay extras package is more extensive, with additional featurettes on Marco Beltrani's Oscar-nominated score, the history of the railroads out west, the guns used for the film and an interview with author Elmore Leonard about his days writing pulp Westerns. The interactive `Inside Yuma' feature isn't entirely successful, slightly awkward to navigate between script, storyboards and on-set footage (the latter not helped by running the film's soundtrack over the top of them) while the historical timeline feature is useless because the text is so tiny as to be illegible even on a large screen TV (what is it with some Blu-rays and miniscule unreadable text?).

Fiction and reality are explosively blended together in the figure of actor Kinski playing the mad ambition and hubris of Don Lope de Aguerre,with eagle eyes and swivelling, lurching body, screaming mad and creating havoc on the set for Herzog,who's attempting to realize the hallucinatory strangeness of the conquistador's undertaking, colonial conquest run amuck. Far from Castille,this is a tale of moral degradation in the heart of darkness.Herzog stages history,like others stage plays( spoken by Kinski's insane conquistador).We get a sense of historical adventure,combined with risk-taking cinematic history,awesome power and mystery,realism and presence.It's as if Herzog breathed in upon a peak in Darien to evoke those who travelled in realms of gold.These men were mad,full of visions and hallucinations, driven by lust for power and glory,to follow in the footsteps of Cortez, The Peruvian river settings are in truth deadly dangerous, and Herzog expertly captures the immense power of nature against man. The pace is fast and the destructive and ominous theme of power confused with madness, strong and powerful. But while it is over quite quickly, the film sits with you far beyond the running time. Despite problems such as the dangerous rain forest location, illness amongst the crew and a screaming mad Klaus Kinski, Herzog somehow manages to create a hypnotic tale about greed, power and madness. Set in 16th century Peru, the film centres on the expedition of a group of conquistadores to the lost city of El Dorado.The film has been criticized for having no narrative.I disagree.The forward momentum is aided by the hazards,the hardships,the madness that draws these people into the jungle in the first place(and Herzog for undertaking the same mad journey,subjecting crew,actors and extras to the same hazards and hardships). Almost immediately, the group begins to fragment, with a forward expedition being sent on, and this continual unravelling will be the main dynamic of the narrative as we follow them on their hopeful(but to us obviously hopeless)quest.There is a rhythmic flow of documentary-like imagery, heavily stylized epic shots with great costumes, colour, soundscapes, cinematography, capturing the awesome power of untameable nature and a constant sense of dread of the unknown, effectively assisted by the haunting Popol Vuh score. Insulated from the threat of retribution from the Spanish government, Aguirre begins to subvert Ursua's authority,citing Cortez who disobeyed orders to conquer Mexico. Aguirre dissents on the rescue of a crew aboard a raft stranded on the side of the river. He instructs the men to gather materials without Ursua's knowledge or consent. He orders the death of a soldier loyal to Ursua.However,the path to El Dorado proves to be elusive as the crew fall victim to treacherous currents,inconspicuously laden traps, and Indian attacks. Driven by the promise of wealth and conquest, Aguirre forces a mutiny when Ursua decides to retreat into the mountains.The noble ideal of civilizing indigenous people are only rationalizations of greed and narcissm-as elusive as El Dorado-deceptive goals. Using recurring animal imagery, Herzog distills human behavior to its base, primeval instincts: the transportation of caged chickens down the formidable mountain; the mistreatment of a horse on the raft; the capture of a wild boar at a deserted village; the relocation of baby rats by its mother; the plague of monkeys in the final sequence.We go on a downward spiral on a whirlpool of fatigue. The haunting quality is captured by imagery as a severed head continues talking as it rolls to the ground; a boat sits lodged atop a tree; a hooded horse stands in perfect stillness on the edge of the jungle. And outdoing all else for pure nuttiness is Klaus Kinski in the title role. Aguirre is a masterpiece for the Great Outdoors,its landscape and its ambition.\",\n",

The story is simple, and, yes, one might might be reminded, as is one of the characters in this movie, of the Christie based mini-classic (starring, among others, Barry Fitzgerald) whose title was changed from that of the book to Ten Little Indians (look up the title assigned at its birth to see why it was changed). As I say, the story has a group of people blocked from further travel by flooded highways,  staying in a roadside motel, which had been built on land on which, long ago, American Indians had been forced to camp, only to die of starvation and disease. Among them is a convicted murderer and his guard, who also had been trapped by the flood. After  a bit of getting acquainted, trouble begins.John Cusack, Ray Liotta and Amanda  Peet, lead a talented cast in the ever more gripping drama. The story is built up neatly, piece by piece, to a surprising denouement  and counterpoint. The suspense is nicely graduated so as to keep one attuned with no accumulated fatigue to the end. This is one where knowing the end will much diminish the pleasure derived from the movie. There is sufficient violence to require care about the maturity of the viewer, but it is nothing compared to the average violent film these days.\",\n",

The plot is typically loose, silly and predictable, a narrow-sighted exercise on the same level as Mr. Mom or Stir Crazy, but still manages to slip in a few biting observations about the period's culture... most of which are validated by Murray's deliciously sardonic delivery. Costars Geena Davis and Randy Quaid are often just along for the ride, though, delivering bad lines with all the subtlety of a brick to the face, and nobody ever seems to take their predicament terribly seriously. Practically bad but inexplicably charming, like many of its genre-mates from the late '80s, it's good for a few shockingly large laughs but wilts under closer examination.\",\n",

She's linked to a married man, who just so happens to be a wanted criminal, and when she witnesses something she wasn't supposed to, she going into immediate hiding.  The one place no one would look for her is the one place she would rather not go, but before she knows it she's packing it in with nuns at the local convent.  Her shady backstory is replaced by a fake one, so as to keep the innocence of the rest of the nuns, and soon she is making a bigger impact than she even thought she would, especially in the choir department.`Sister Act' is a rousing good time that hands Goldberg a plum role for her kind of humor.  She's cleaner than usual, but with the edge needed to give this staying power and make it believable.  The rest of the supporting cast is clearly up for the challenge as well, with Maggie Smith giving her usual cranky turn and Kathy Najimy and Wendy Makkena serving up hilarity as the worldly un-wise `sisters'.  It is Harvey Keitel that really slams it out of the park here with a fun yet commanding presence.The musical numbers are spunky and fresh and the climax is filled with unexpected tension and a wonderful moral center.

              "       \"Bruno is Borat's younger cinema sibling - wisecracking, though not wise; a look-at-me risk-taker without a plan. In Bruno, Sasha Baron Cohen gives us Borat's brilliant expose of anti-Semitism in an almost homophobic wrapper. Bruno is a not very bright Austrian fashion designer who is fired from his TV job and comes to America to become famous. The film has a loose narrative about Bruno's search for fame, peppered with stunts (some real, some staged) showing Bruno getting into embarrassing situations. He ends up in a hotel bed, shackled to another man, both wearing bondage gear, and needing hotel management to help find the key to be set free. He annoys a group of swingers by talking to them while they have sex. He shows a disgusted focus group a supposed pilot for a TV series, which includes film of himself dancing in butt-baring pants and gyrating his bare genitalia. Unlike Borat, whose stunts showed off the anti-Semitism and/or prudishness of various American groups, Bruno is so over the top in its depiction of wild homosexual antics that it disgusts the viewer about gays themselves rather than about homophobic reactions.And reactions the film does get. An audience in Arkansas is treated to a cage match that turns into an erotic grope-a-thon between two men. Audience members gasp in horror, then throw beers and chairs at the men. Bruno, wearing a very gay version of orthodox Jewish clothing, is chased down the streets of an Israeli town  by enraged onlookers. He is kicked out of a meeting with a member of the Palestinian Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade. Bruno tries to sneak, in the middle of the night, into the tents of a bunch of Alabama hunters, who predictably react with distaste. All of this makes for fascinating viewing, but does it say anything? Bruno mostly irritates because he insists on pushing his extreme actions in of the face of those around him -- most of whom need to be pushed very hard to react. If he's trying to show that the world is a homophobic place, he ends up showing that most people will tolerate about anything as long as it is not shoved down their throats.I have to give SBC points for his daring. Going onto a talk show with an African American audience, toting a black baby named OJ (traded in Africa for an iPhone) took guts. Talking to terrorists was ballsy. Enduring potential violence in the South took courage, as  did engaging a pair of Christian gay conversion therapists. But much of the movie was funny in the way that poking a sleeping lion until it roars is funny. It says more about the man with the stick than about the lion.In the end, Bruno is more spectacle than examination. Unfortunately, it may have cemented a hyper-sexualized caricature of gays more firmly into the minds of many.\",\n",

Yet, such is the inherent interest of plagues affecting human populations, that this film stays sufficiently alive to warrant taking the time, though not much money,  to watch. You will not see fine actors like Dustin Hoffman, Morgan Freeman, Donald Sutherland or Kevin Spacey doing anything like what they can do with a good script; in fact, one is somewhat embarrassed to have them delivering dialog and emotions which they had to know were inadvertent parodies of that in much better pictures.

Peck's performance oozes a large dose of machismo, but finally he too lets the wave of emotions prevail.And not to be forgotten - the City of Rome is another major star of the movie, bringing a very refreshing change from the Hollywood of old, where you could see big stars in front of moving pictures in the studio. Probably there is not a viewer who wouldn't like to see the place after seeing this film.Understated and gentle, while at times surprisingly funny and entertaining throughout, Roman Holiday remains as fresh as ever, largely also due to the ever-popular topic - a love affair between a celebrity and a common person.\",\n",

A rock solid suspense/action/adventure genre-bender, From Russia With Love eases from gripping moments of tension to smart bits of detective work with almost no effort at all... a careful balance that this series isn't usually able to manage so efficiently. As a direct follow-up to the events of Dr. No, it's also an impressive step up in almost every category - enriching and expanding upon many of that film's good ideas while cleanly slicing away most of the bad ones.

              "       \"I write my editorial tribute to this turbulent, warm-hearted nostalgia piece of Americana, which director Jane Anderson serves up like a slice of sweet apple pie on the 15th anniversary of the passing of its remarkable protagonist, played by Julianne Moore with as much cheerfulness and grit as Evelyn Ryan herself may have possessed.Her story is one in which H.T. Leslie's observation, The game of life is not so much  holding a good hand as playing a poor hand well., receives a highly profound summation through the writings of her late daughter, Tuff.A one-time humor columnist for a newspaper in Sherwood, Ohio, Evelyn becomes enamored of a band singer, Leo Kelly Ryan(Woody Harrelson), who has a promising career, but after losing his singing voice in an auto accident, he takes a job as a machinist, and as he and his bride begin their lives together, is driven to drink. In what could be construed as co-dependency, Evelyn explains his behavior to the audience, stating that if he appears to be immature, selfish, or mean to remember that he lost his voice while she kept hers.Despite these problems, they proceed to parent 10 children, including Lea Anne( Monte Gagne), Bruce( Jake Scott, Trevor Morgan), Rog(Erik Knusden, Jack Murray), Dick(Robert Clark), Bub(Michael Seater), Tuff(Jordan Todosey, Ellary Porterfield), Mike(Ryan Price, Brendan Price), Barb(Jessica Pollack,Melanie Tonello), Betsy(Emily Persich, Julia Morgan Thompson), and Dave(Luca and Brando Barbaro, Maxwell Uretsky, Conor Sharp).A frequently embittered Kelly drinks away a third of his meager income during the course of this story, which takes place  predominantly in the 1950s and '60s when housewives like Evelyn turned to jingle writing contests sponsored by companies that produced household items, sustaining their families through the prizes they won through them.Evelyn proves to be one of the best at these endeavors, often winning the right prize at just the right time-one of the more relevant ones being a grocery store shopping spree which enables the struggling family to eat better than they normally did (the book on which this story is based notes that they were often dependent on relatives for help in that area).Evelyn previously won an icebox, which she is now able to fill because of the grocery store  shopping spree. But as is often the case, with each prize won, Kelly responds with bitterness, viewing each of these blessings as a threat to his role as the family's breadwinner. While he might have been more grateful for what was working in his life, a modern audience might appreciate him as a product of his time. But his drunken rampages previously resulted in his damaging the lid of the icebox at one point. While even at a young age, Tuff fearlessly confronts her father about his behavior, police called in to deal with the violent domestic situation, as well as the family priest, Father McCague(David Gardiner)are more sympathetic to Kelly, the latter failing to acknowledge that Evelyn does her best as a wife and mother, never really addressing the problems that need to be addressed and quizzing her youngest on whether on not his is being obedient and saying his prayers. Little Dave notes how much the priest's breath smells like his father's, suggesting that the priest's empathy with Kelly stems from his own tendency to have way too much Communion.Four of the older children leave home during the course of the story. Prior to that, we learn how contesters including Evelyn, use their children's names in their contest entries, and how the winners are selected.. Kelly himself occasionally partakes in contesting, but Evelyn has to resolve a dispute between him and Bruce over one of the prizes at one point.Trouble with some of the kids deprives Evelyn of her chance to travel when she wins trips to various places(although in reality, she and Bruce did get to go to New York), and the most difficult scene to watch is when Evelyn, who has often been in arrears in paying Ray the milkman(Simon Reynolds), is grabbed at by a belligerent Kelly, causing her to fall and spill the bottles of milk and severely cut herself, earning him Tuff's ire. Neighbor Mrs. Bidlack (Susan Merson), lends assistance. The horrific episode ends with a bandaged Evelyn still having written  a jingle in one of her ever-present notebook, and retaining a buoyant level of optimism.Nowadays such incidents would be handled differently.In 1963, after previous failed attempts, Evelyn, who does not drive, is finally able to attend a meeting of the Affadaisies, a group of fellow contesters, at the home of Emma Hartzler(Catherine Fitch), who is confined to an iron lung, in Goshen, Indiana. Like Evelyn, Emma handles adversity with much humor . Dortha Schaefer ( Laura Dern), a farm wife, who writes for a newspaper as Evelyn used to, and with whom Evelyn has been corresponding, is the first to greet her.En route to that rendezvous, the fan belt of the car needed repairing, and the feisty Tuff has a frank conversation with her mother about her feeling's about Evelyn's life. But her mother reassures her that she is content.Her time with the Affadaisies is enjoyable, and it is interesting to see  future writer, Tuff, among the group. These ladies include Gladys Tierney(Carolyn Scott) Betty yearling(Lindsay Leese) and Betty White(Tracey Hoyt), all of whom share Evelyn's knack for winning formidable prizes through jingle writing contests. The women, primly arrayed in  either well-coiffed ' dos  and/or hats and gloves, critique each other's work, and discuss whether or not the days of their style of contesting are coming to an end. Before her departure, Evelyn is presented with the last entry form of a Dr. Pepper contest.Once home, she deals with another crisis caused by Kelly's locking the other kids out of the house, due to not wanting them to see him cry from fear of Evelyn's abandoning him. He becomes violent again, Tuff jumps him, and Evelyn throws the Jello she'd made for dessert  on him to get him to cool off as we hear a recital of her jingle for that product. Evelyn  calmly explains how trouble with the fan belt prolonged their outing.The next crisis results from the news of impending foreclosure of their home due to Kelly's having taken out a second mortgage two years prior without Evelyn's knowledge, and not paying it back. Decisions about farming the kids out to relatives or neighbors must be considered. The kids gather in the closet to jointly pray the Rosary, hoping their mother wins a formidable monetary prize, and we will see whether these children who pray together will stay together.The basest point of all finds the Ryans feeding their kids the last remaining packages of soup, vainly trying to convince the kids that the weevils in them are spices.To be fair, Kelly could be generous towards his family, wanting his wife to have a decent piece of furniture, and his children to eat steak. But in modern times, women would not be encouraged to stay in such a difficult union, especially with the risk of daughters ending up in abusive relationships and sons becoming abusers. But after one final triumph for Evelyn, we learn that her children(the actual ones of whom make a poignant cameo) turn out alright despite much childhood adversity--a true testament to their mother's faith, fortitude, and indomitable spirit!\",\n",

A fresh-faced Lindsay Lohan takes the leading role where it's meant to go, but stops short of adding anything to the production. That's probably best left in the hands of her co-stars, anyway; a waspy trio of entitled blonde brats who are satisfyingly, but not irredeemably, malevolent.

It features two central figures, one of them our point-of-view character. USMC Colonel Jiggs Casey (Kirk Douglas) happens to be personal aide to 4-star General James Mattoon Scott (Burt Lancaster), the very opinionated Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General Scott, a right wing extremist, cuts a polarizing figure. SEVEN DAYS IN MAY posits a highly charged political climate in which the Presidency is at its most unpopular.Poor embattled President Lyman (Fredric March) is this perceived weakling who's advocating a disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union, a proposed course of action that infuriates huge chunks of the American masses. Protesters demand the President's head and they rally around General Scott. Scott is vociferously against the cessation of the nuclear race. Might makes right. Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition, said some patriot. The general believes he has the people's backing. We see what happens when Col. Jiggs Casey, left in the dark, begins to suspect Scott and the other Joint Chiefs of Staff of planning to overthrow the government.I think everything good has already been said about this film, so I'm just here to echo everyone else's heaps of praise. Razor-edged suspense with consummate execution with thought-provoking themes. This is very much in director John Frankenheimer's wheelhouse, a perfect complement to his earlier political thriller,The Manchurian Candidate (Special Edition)(1962). Burt Lancaster submits a chilling performance as the patriotic military zealot, and he's got his buddy, Kirk Douglas, to thank for it. Douglas had wanted him on board this film project and so ceded the juicier role to Burt as an incentive. It's an all-around highly professional cast of actors, with folks like Martin Balsam, Ava Gardner, and Edmond O'Brien making a memorable impression in supporting roles. Rod Serling wrote the screenplay, and really all it required was one cautionary left turn of a twist for this movie to pass as an episode of Twilight Zone. Luckily, Jiggs Casey has got his thinking cap on, sniffing out a shady horceracing betting pool and, from that, unearthing an unthinkable coup d'etat.\",\n",

The first we hear will be Bill Hayley's Rock Around the Clock; the last, The Beach Boys' We'll Be Having Fun All Summer Long(which was actually released two years after this story takes place).The adventures that take place in between showcase the talent of many young stars who would come to eminence later in the decade, and in fact influence many of their vehicles that launched them to stardom.A year before starring in his second-long-running series, we see former child-star Ron Howard as Steve Bolander, who has spent all summer encouraging his friend, Curt Henderson(Richard Dreyfuss), to go to college in the East and see more of the world, but now stands undecided about whether or not he wants to do the same. Bolander has been dating Curt's sister, Laurie(A pre-Laverne and Shirley era Cindy Williams)and has to make a decision about their relationship. He ends up loaning his nerdy friend, Terry The Toad Fields  his 1958 Impala, in which Terry will pick up a free-spirited young blonde named Debbie Dunham(Candy Clark), that he sees on the streets, and they share a night of confrontation with a guy Debby previously dated, the theft of the car, a brawl, and Terry's getting sick, all of which somehow impresses his date.Their friend John Milner( Paul Le Mat), who has the reputation of being the smoothest cruiser in the state, drives around in a yellow Deuce, which earns the insults of fellow cruiser, Bob Alfalfa( Harrison Ford--note he has the surname of a car)who is initially with his  girl, played by Debralee Scott. But these kids change cars in the middle of the street as frequently as a person can change socks, and while John was trying to impress one girl in a group of girls in one car, he soon finds his shotgun seat occupied by the girl's sister, an adventurous teenybopper named Carol Morrison( MacKenzie Phillips), all of 14 years old. A good bit of his time will be spent figuring out how to get Carol to go home and at one point, he has to explain to a cop what she is doing in his car. Milner explains to the cop, and also to others on the road that she is  his young cousin.As these vignettes take place, the central figure tying them together is the XERB disc jockey Wolfman Jack(Himself), firmly in command of his post.Carol tells John that her mother won't let her listen to the Wolfman due purportedly to his race, reflecting the prejudices of the time.During their drive, John has to reassure the insecure girl that her family don't resent her. But at some point, the two have fun spraying shaving cream on the windows of cars on the road in response to a water balloon being thrown at Carol.Curt's impetus for wanting to meet the Wolfman is to dedicate a song to a mysterious Blonde(Suzanne Somers) he saw in a white 1956 Thunderbird who had mouthed I love you to him while riding with Steve and Laurie.He receivesno help in tracking her down, and later receives  word from other girls who enter the car that she is either a prostitute or a trophy wife.But in  the meantime, he somehow leaves that car and finds himself in the company of the local gang, known as the Pharaohs, led by Joe Young(Bo Hopkins), and pulls a prank on the cops with them.Steve and Laurie have a spat and part company. When Laurie sees Steve chatting with a waitress at Mel's, she mistakenly believes he is being unfaithful, and enters Bob Alfalfa's car with near-fatal consequences.Curt eventually arrives at the radio  station to dedicate  a song to the mysterious blonde, and chats with the disc jockey, who he eventually recognizes as the Wolfman. He is advised to go ahead with his plans to attend school in the East, as the D.J. regrets not being able to see more of the world, and points out that as he is not as young as he used to be and would take the same opportunity to travel, if he were a young man presently.At dawn, Curt does get to chat briefly with the pretty blonde while he is in a pay phone booth, but must be content with the fact that that is all the time he will have with her.As a plane carries Curt to a new life, George Lucas gives the film what was an innovative twist for its time by revealing the fates of the main characters at the end.This 90-minute-flick about teens riding around in the dark has become a classic, and in honor of the 40th anniversary of its release, I pay all due homage to a cinematic piece which, although it takes place mostly in darkness, will continue to ride on and shine on for for many years to come!\",\n",
              "       \"A film with a lot of interesting ideas almost completely buried in over-the-top action sequences, mind-numbingly boring dialogue and surprisingly shoddy-looking special effects, this EXTREMELY loose suggestion of the stories of Isaac Asimov would have the master rolling in his grave, if he were trite and clich&eacute;d enough to engage in it. Mostly a mishmash of BLADE RUNNER, A.I. and every antihero cop movie ever made, the film follows Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) on a quest to find the killer of Dr. Alfred Lanning, the genius behind the workforce-dominating humanoid robots that fill up nearly every scene in this clunky CGI/live amalgamation. The film supposedly takes place in Chicago, but there is not one slight reminder of that city until a shot of the river near the very end that's vaguely recognizable. Spooner hates robots and suspects them for some reason from the beginning, but we never get to know him well enough to care; the film spends much more time erotically fascinated by Will Smith's big pecs than it does in creating a cohesive person for him to play.Of course, robots aren't people; robots can't kill, or so we are told. There are many quick, fleeting references to interesting themes throughout the film such as:* what does it mean to be human?* is hating a harmless machine similar to being racist (both Spooner and his long-suffering boss are black, in a world that seems to have nearly, but not quite, forgotten that fact)?* at one point does a human with replacement parts start to become more machine than man * does it emasculate, or ameliorate humanity to have its menial tasks performed by something man-created?* can you actually program a machine to think for itself?etc etc...but they are all subordinated to endless chases and explosions and gun battles. There are no characters of consequence here, and even the seeming possibility of a love story between Spooner and scientist Susan Calvin (based on one of Asimov's most famous characters but unrecognizable apart from the name) goes nowhere. There just isn't time with all the action they have to put in! Not to mention dozens of product placements, and, did I forget to mention, Will Smith's perfect-as-a-robot sculpted body. In fact, given the way the principle actors seem to sleepwalk through this film, the most interesting idea I was left with was a question as to who and what was most robotic in the film; was there, in fact, any human touch to the movie at all?\",\n",
              "       \"Being a Disney production, The Rookie could easily have settled to become a weepy dramatic tale dripping with over-dramatized scenes.  Luckily, thanks to great acting and an attention to detail, this movie is instead a great human drama focusing on baseball themes.For a basic plot summary, The Rookie tells the true story of Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid), a 36-year old high school chemistry teacher in Texas.  After a lifetime of being uprooted time and time again by his military father (Brian Cox), Morris also had his big-league baseball dream cut short by arm injuries.  While coaching high school baseball in Texas and raising a family, he suddenly discovers that his left arm has some serious juice left in it.  On a bet that inspires his young charges, Morris shows up at a MLB tryout and begins the journey he had thought was dormant forever.The reason this movie is so moving is because it weaves so many human-drama themes into the proceedings.  Many potential viewers may dismiss it as a baseball movie, but to do so would be foolish.  This is more truly a story of family and one man's journey to make peace with his life.  I can't think of anyone who wouldn't like a story like this.  It is just so emotional as Morris interacts with his children, wife, parents, and others affiliated with the baseball side of his life.Only helping the drama spring to life is the incredible acting.  I've seen Quaid in many movie roles, and this one is eclipsed by none of them.  His body language and facial expressions carry the emotionally-charged scenes.  The supporting cast around him (especially Rachel Griffiths and Angus Young as Morris' wife and son) also shines and really, truth be told, are very much more than supporting.  They are the reasons why Morris does what he does.Overall, I consider The Rookie to be the epitome of a solid, wholesome family drama (and just an incredibly compelling story to boot).  I'm a big baseball fan, so perhaps I can appreciate the deeper, more embedded themes of the film more than the non-sports viewer, but to me this is five-star material all the way.\",\n",

              "       'A classic Chaplin masterpiece that contains both the shoe-eating incident (inspired by a true story) and the dancing dinner rolls-on-forks scene (inspired by Fatty Arbuckle, but improved upon by Chaplin), the film is full of funny scenes, like Charlie oblivious to being followed by a bear, the cane-in-the-snow scene, and masterpieces of physical comedy like the windy doorway, and the teetering house (and its narrow escape). Big Jim hallucinating and seeing Charlie as a man-sized chicken is also sheer genius. There&#8217;s still a scary moment when Black Larsen kills two men in cold blood, but also some sexy romancing (and, in one of the versions of the film, a long lingering kiss).This DVD comes with two versions of the movie, the original 1925 release, and a 1942 re-release version that is narrated by Chaplin and has the scene description cards removed (unnecessary). It&#8217;s certainly a strange format, but interesting enough given that it&#8217;s Chaplin&#8217;s own voice. Chaplin also wrote an original soundtrack for this version &#8211; talk about attention to detail! Funny dialogue works its way in, like &#8220;I&#8217;m going away, and when I return I shall come back,&#8221; and &#8220;I said don&#8217;t breathe, stupid.&#8221; Funny how Big Jim looks like Peter Grant, the manager of Led Zeppelin.On top of the two versions of the film, the DVD contains many bonus features such as a five-minute intro, another episode of &#8220;Chaplin Today&#8221; (27 minutes) trailers (8:46), and 25 posters. The intro explains how the shoe-eating story was inspired by the tale of the Donner party disaster in the Sierra Nevada mountains, when travelers were trapped by the snow and survived through cannibalism and eating their moccasins. We also get a scene of Mary Pickford recounting in 1965 how Chaplin had visited her and Douglas Fairbanks at their home Pickfair, and had looked at 3-D stereoscopic images of the Gold Rush and seen the incredible images of the winter queue at Chilkoot Pass. We also get scenes of Lita Gray talking about Chaplin in 1980, discussing his directorial style. This was the first film Chaplin started with a fully-developed script, something he wouldn&#8217;t do again until 1947 and Monsieur Verdoux. He cast Lillita McMurray, who was also in The Kid, now 16, and she became his lover &#8211; and was soon pregnant. Renamed Lita Gray, both were miserable in the marriage; Lita was replaced in the film by Georgia Hale, and production dragged on. The Chilkoot Pass scene was reproduced in the Sierra Nevada mountains by creating in mid-winter a 700 metre path at 3,300 metres, using 600 tramps brought in from Sacramento as extras. Chaplin intended to do the whole film there, but it was difficult to shoot scenes there (only a few made it into the film, like Big Jim chasing the Little Tramp around in the snow), so they reproduced Alaska on the United Artists lot in Los Angeles using a backlot, a constructed mountain scene, and 100 barrels of flower&#8230;The film was a huge success, with some audiences demanding an encore of the dinner rolls dance scene. Imagine something like that happening today!!',\n",
              "       \"Like the first day of fall when the incessant heat breaks, the breeze unusually cool reminding you of past seasons, the spectacular imagination of Stephen King is once again en vogue. The everyman author of Maine, perhaps the most prolific obsessive-compulsive writer in American history, has penned a sequel to The Shining (Doctor Sleep: A Novel), produced a hit TV series based on his entertaining 2009 novelUnder the Dome: A Noveland yet another remake, for whatever reason, has been forged from Carrie. So bloggers and writers produce lists, endless lists, of the best film versions of Kings many books.His initial burst of creativity, erupting in 1974 with his debut novelCarrieand marching almost a decade with unparalleled success toPet Sematary, will never be matched again. It was during this span he wrote his greatest novel, which led to the best film ever made from one of his books.I have always argued King's greatest work was the quiet 1979 bestseller The Dead Zone (Signet). I'm not sure what it is about the book I return to so often. I saw the 1983 film version The Dead Zone the day it opened at a faceless multiplex theater in my college town in central Texas. To this day I remember the film's opening credits, the dark, cold landscape and the gentle chords of Michael Kamen's musical score. Filmed in Canada by master director David Cronenberg, it ranks as the greatest film version of a King novel -- sullen, contemplative and utterly brilliant.And so the lists, the endless lists, mention Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shining, Frank Darabont'sThe Shawshank Redemptionand Brian De Palma'sCarrie, but they almost always forget this film. While this is not Cronenberg's greatest work (Dead Ringersanyone?), it still has his thumbprint. Unlike Kubrick, he pays a respectful nod to King's novel. It is a unique meshing of larger-than-life visions, the end result an unusually melancholic horror classic.The key is Christopher Walken as Johnny Smith. A monumental acting talent (and eccentric), Walken's performance is his finest in a lead role. He plays an anguished, disturbed man who awakens from a five-year coma after a horrible car accident to discover he has profound psychic ability. This is not a gift  -- when the visions appear, they have all the pleasantry of a fierce migraine -- and he has to insulate himself within the safety of his parent's modest home.Walken's Smith has lost everything, including his career as a school teacher (King's job before being published) and his fiancee who has since married another man. His visions bring him brief fame and he must burrow from the spotlight. He's brought out of hiding by small-town Sheriff Bannerman (the perfectly cast Tom Skerritt) whose community has been preyed upon by an unknown serial killer. Prior to this, Smith's visions have happened by accident, and he now finds himself forced to use his cursed powers for intentional good.This extraordinary second act is the film's highlight, as Walken, adorned in black like a reluctant oracle, limps to a crime scene through ominous slush and snow. You're never sure a vision will come, and suddenly, he is standing with the victim as the murderer strolls towards her. The killer is local, and his ghastly demise, different from King's novel, is pure Cronenberg. That's as far as I am going to go, except it's an amazing moment of suspense and shock.A theme running throughout the film, also a Cronenberg touch, is the dysfunction of domineering parents. Smith's mother (Jackie Burroughs), radically religious, sees his visions as a gift from God, continually quoting scripture and forcing her vicarious hopes into his destroyed life. Colleen Dewhurst has a great cameo as the mother of the discovered killer, whose son is imprisoned within childhood. The great character actor Anthony Zerbe also does his usual fine work as an emotionally distant father concerned with business, hiring Smith as a tutor for his troubled son. Smith becomes a father-figure to the child, and with great insight, brings him out of his shell while providing worth to his own personal losses.But the true purpose of Smith's gift becomes apparent in the final act. I will not reveal too much suffice to say Smith is forced to attempt a political assassination to save the world. Just about everyone alive in 1963 was traumatized by the monumentally shocking assassination of President John F. Kennedy. King certainly was, and has referenced the tragedy multiple times in his works, not to mention coming full circle with the terrific 2011 book11/22/63: A Novel.Johnny Smith is not Lee Harvey Oswald, and the corrupt politician he stalks does not even remotely resemble Kennedy (though oddly, has much in common with politicians today). But what Oswald did with a below-average rifle is unthinkable, a single shot causing an epic tear in the fabric of human history. His motives will be forever unknown (thanks Jack Ruby), and such haunting ghosts float in the realm of supernatural what if? It's not hard to see where King came up with the inspirational seed. The difference between our imaginations and his, is that he can write a book as good as The Dead Zone, leading to Cronenberg's pensive and wonderful classic.\",\n",
              "       \"Directed with flare and style, this little scene and maybe underappreciated Coen Brothers film is a wonderful example of how a film's title can be misleading.  Most people (myself included) glance at the title and the movie poster and raise an eyebrow.  It just sounds and looks rather off-putting.  Despite names like Coen and Newman on the cover, the way the film was (and still is) marketed leaves a lot to be desired.The film is GREAT!`The Hudsucker Proxy' almost reminded me of the Coen Brothers take on a 1940's newspaper comedy (think `My Girl Friday' mixed with Coen Brothers humor and a dash of Woody Allen physical antics) and I was pretty much hooked from scene one.The film tells the story of Norville Barnes, a hapless young man looking for a job with zero experience but a lot of ambition.  He has ideas, but his ideas are met with sketisism.  That is, until he seeks employment with Hudsucker Industries the very same day the president and owner of the company commits suicide.  Left in a bind, Sidney Mussburger, who is somewhat left in charge after the loss of his boss, makes an executive decision.  In order to sway the masses away from buying stock in the company, so that Mussburger and his cronies can own the company entirely, he hires Barnes, who he deems an idiot, and places him in position of President of the company.His plan backfires.Throw in a sassy journalist determined to expose Barnes for a moron and a guardian angel in the form of a mysterious employee/narrator and you have an engaging film that has style, substance and moments of pure hilarity.Robbins is aces here, delivering a brilliantly comedic performance that contains the right amount of `black comedy' needed to sell every scene.  Working with Robert Altman paid off for him.  Newman is steady evil, and Charles Durning has a brilliant cameo as the dead Waring Hudsucker.  I honestly can't decide if Jennifer Jason Leigh is the film's weakest link or the reason I love the movie so much.  She is so abrasive, like a complete caricature (although many of the characters feel like they are ripped from a comic strip) and yet that is either a delight or a detractor; but I honestly can't decide which.  She made me cringe and she made me smile, a lot of times in the same moment.Regardless, the film is wonderful and needs to be seen!\",\n",
              "       \"This chiller from director Roman Polanski is indispensable for fans of the horror genre.  What Polanski achieves here is a successful merger of the macabre and the satirical, the psychological and the supernatural.  The primary setting, a gothic apartment complex in the heart of Manhattan, is a claustrophobe's nightmare.  Polanski is exclusively old school in the sense that this film recalls the classic horror of producer Val Lewton where what you don't see is scarier than what you do.  You're not certain whether Rosemary is suffering from pre partum anxiety or is in reality the target of a witch coven.  It helps that his leading lady is perfectly cast.  Mia Farrow has a waifish fragility but she also demonstrates the inner maternal strength to protect her unborn child from any harm.  Farrow is virtually in every scene in the movie and her every move is gripping.  It's kind of ironic that only Polanski and Woody Allen effectively tapped into Farrow's strengths as an actress.  What today's horrormeisters fail to grasp is restraint.  Granted this film may be the product of restrictions that were crumbling at the time of the film's release in 1968 but that may fall in the film's favor.

The advertising campaign for this film claimed that director Sam Peckinpah set out to tell the tale of a cowardly pacifist (Dustin Hoffman) who finally gets a burst of testosterone and becomes a man when his home is threatened.Now that plot line might have made for an interesting and morally appealing film.  Instead, what Peckinpah has delivered is the tale of a man whose whole life is built around self-delusions: nothing about his world is as it seems.  The peaceful English town he lives in is actually a cesspool of violence and cruelty; his marriage is in reality a lie; his house is not the fortress he thinks it is.  And what is the main problem, the driving force behind all this dysfunction?  Well, women, of course.  His toothsome wife (Susan George) is actually a tramp who flashes her breasts at men she used to date and who are still trying to bed her.  When she gets raped, she says no at first, but soon enough, she starts enjoying it.  You know how women are (and yes, I'm being angrily sarcastic at Peckinpah's unconscionable use of that old cliche).  Naturally, she keeps this information from her husband.  And one of the young girls in the village?  Since Hoffman won't respond to her sexual advances, she instead approaches a simpleton who has a reputation for molesting young women, and tries to seduce him, which leads her father and his drunken friends to go on a murderous rampage when they can't find her.  (Naturally, this being a completely nihilistic film, we know she's dead, even though none of the characters in the film know it.)The whole mess ends in the handful of drunken village men assaulting Hoffman's Home Sweet Home as if the Frankenstein monster were hiding inside.  And Hoffman takes on the invaders and, well ... far be it from me to tell you whether or not he survives ... I'd hate to ruin the suspense.  Let's just say that it all fades out with what is supposed to be an ironically symbolic exchange between two characters that comes off as unbearably trite and corny.Two stars is being charitable.

The film is set in Charlestown, the oldest neighborhood in the city of Boston, a one-square mile hotbed of drugs, muggings, armed robberies and other assorted nefarious activities.  Affleck plays a member of a gang of second-generation criminals who were born and raised in ... and seemingly unable to escape from ... this toxic environment.  Following a daring bank robbery, Affleck makes the mistake of falling in love with one of the bank's employees (Rebecca Hall), who is unaware that he was the thief who took her hostage during the heist.  Complicating matters is the fact that the FBI is closing in, putting all sorts of pressure on the gang, particularly the violent hothead (Jeremy Renner) whose family took Affleck under their wing when his father went to prison.  Now the gang is being pressured by an underworld kingmaker (Pete Postlethwaite) to pull off another huge, tremendously complicated and risky job.Not only does Affleck do yeoman's service as an actor and director, he manages to pull amazing performances from the rest of the cast, especially Renner who received a boatload of Supporting Actor nominations, including bids for the Oscar and the Golden Globe.  In his penultimate performance (he died before the movie was released), Pete Postlethwaite oozes barely contained menace, and actress Blake Lively is disturbingly effective as Renner's junkie sister.  Kudos also to Rebecca Hall, Jon Hamm (as a hard-nosed FBI agent), and Chris Cooper, who makes a strong impression in his brief scene as Affleck's bitter father.There are numerous versions of the film available on video, including the theatrical cut, an extended cut, and a special collector's edition.  I viewed the single-disc blu-ray, which offered both the theatrical version and the extended cut on the same disc.  Many enthusiasts were concerned about the possibility of compression issues affecting this release, but I thought it looked and sounded fantastic.  I'm usually kind of picky about such things, but I was so involved in the story and the performances that any flaws went unnoticed.

I don't shop here and so it goes with this brutal and for the most part disgusting Stallone showcase, in which Sly's then wife(Brigitte Nielsen) provides bad acting and ample cleavage as a fashion model (what else?) who's the only witness against a crazed cult of serial killers.Cobra likes to kill first and leave the questions to his disgruntled superior officers, who call on the maverick lawman when all other options have failed. This movie does have a modest following, and for what it's worth, a few of the action sequences are disjointedly exciting.COBRA also takes me back to memory lane to when it was theatrically released in the Summer of 1986 when I was 13 going on 14 years old in the 8th grade and to when I saw it on HBO for the very first time in the Summer of 1987.\",\n",

It's got a few mildly funny moments, but mostly it's a little too over-the-top and not quite arch enough for its own good. The wit is not especially witty. The gold-digger has been done to death, and this one falls somewhere in the middle of the pack for quality. Clooney has a few good lines, but his comedic tics in this are a little too overstated.

But to look at it today, with fresh eyes, the impression might be quite different - and vastly more appreciative. Of all the great 20th century film makers, David Lean made big screen epics that probably best anticipated the age of the flat screen, and in a hi def blu-ray - a format this film richly deserves to seen in - Ryan's Daughter will make compelling viewing. Aside from it's dazzling vistas of the Irish coast and the meticulous recreation of a rough-hewn, turn-of-the-century Irish sea village that provides the backdrop for the story of a tragic affair, Ryan's Daughter offers a passionate testament to the idea of big, bold film making that yearns to tell stories about real and complicated people - not mere stick figures in 3D simulated worlds we've grown accustomed to.\",\n",

The psychological component that figures so prominently here would emerge later in such classics as The Tenant, Rosemary's Baby and Chinatown. Repulsion, in fact, might be the Rosetta Stone of psychological thrillers. It has so many Freudian elements and possibilities that an armchair analyst could spend weeks just in examining the possible signposts and hints strewn throughout the script, some obvious, some very subtle indeed. Clearly the young, beautiful Belgian manicurist played by Deneuve suffers from some sort of personality disorder brought on by childhood trauma. Her Lost Weekend dissolve into madness is handled extremely craftily by Polanski and his cinematographer (Gil Taylor). Auditory and visual clues and signals develop in an extremely naturalistic fashion, which leads to a  tightening of suspense which comes off as uncontrived and really quite masterful, in retrospect. This was the film that really established Polanski in a sparsely inhabited pantheon of important directors whose prime mode of operation is suspense. He ranks right up there with Hitchcock. The only other director of recent vintage who may come close is DePalma, whose 1973 feature, Sisters, was obviously highly influenced by Repulsion.\",\n",

This version, however, shoves them right in your face and never lets you forget them.  When Marmee (Susan Sarandon) delivers her first feminist lecture it comes off sounding more like a commercial than anything you're likely to hear during the course of a normal conversation.  In fact, all of Sarandon's speeches sound like formal addresses one might hear in some lecture hall as opposed to one's home where all of Marmee's views would certainly have been known by rote.  Nothing about these rants is subtle.  Unfortunately, long after they've made their point, they're still relentlessly hammering home their single-minded message, just in case a viewer might have missed or forgotten them.  I found this approach jarring and unwelcomed.  As for the rest of the story, they touch on the same events as all the other adaptations but in a roundabout fashion, adding things, misplacing other key elements.  I have to say, after watching this movie, if I ever had a desire to read the book, I certainly don't have that desire now.  There is very little about this movie that I liked or enjoyed watching.  To make matters worse, they wasted the considerable talent of Mary Wickes in the thankless role of Aunt March, literally giving her nothing to do.

Some things are redone in the original trilogy, and other things are simply out of place much or not up to the standard we have set today. Blade Runner had a lot of issues of the technical nature.... Star Wars is the same. It's obvious he wants to correct things, but then why go about it in such a cheap and unfaithful way?You see Lucas has a problem imo. The new trilogy has a LOT of heavily dated CGI, and if he honestly ever thinks that muck of a thing is going to be decent it needs an entire makeover. Good luck with that. With these original films we have exhaustive fan lists detailing pretty much every mistake from every frame. All he really needs to do is consult these guides or make his own... and then go to work correcting these things to some high degree of quality. Just issue a final cut and invest a 100 million or 2 George! Restore this set as an original set and as a new maximized final cut! So many little mistakes and retouches could be given that extra level of polish. Many fans would not be so adamantly horrified at the treatment of the films if they were finally just given a decent once over.I guess the mistakes they corrected for the bluray release do qualify as something, but they clearly didn't spend the money to actually make this a timeless piece in any regard. It just looks like the surgeon up and left in too many spots.Let's be real here. George Lucas is so far not really a man of quality. He doesn't have it in him if you ask me to bring quality to this series and release the originals and the final cuts with extensive restoration. It's such a huge community but Lucas chooses not to use nor please any of it. It really is a travesty on many levels.

Really, in the grand scheme of things, what does it accomplish? A big battle scene to preserve the sacred city of Gondor, a recruitment drive in the land of the dead to facilitate the former, Frodo and Sam's arrival at Mordor and the big finale at the lava pit. Some exposition can be expected, naturally, and in a few scattered cases it does serve to enrich the extended universe, but for those four primary points to devour over four hours of screen time seems ridiculously excessive.The wealth of character moments on display in Return of the King are generally well done, but rarely do they feel as essential as they did in previous chapters. With very little exception, the primary cast has already worked through their individual arcs before the title card, so there isn't much meat in that respect.As with The Two Towers, the fight scenes (scattered liberally throughout) are appropriately epic and pulse-pounding, though these too push the limits in terms of what the viewing audience is willing to let slide. We're already suspending our disbelief a fair distance in regards to the fellowship's universal fighting prowess, but one particular scene with Legolas and an elephant seems more than a bit excessive. In fact, Legolas is granted an especially silly amount of battlefield respect throughout the series.I could dwell on the negatives all day long - I haven't even touched on the stupid amount of slow motion in the farewell scenes - but at the end of the day, this really isn't a bad film&#8230; just a madly bloated one. It's thoroughly rewarding to finally conclude our journey with the residents of Middle Earth, and when the plot finally gets around to waving goodbye it's a powerful experience. I just can't help but wonder how much better a slim two-hour cut, trimming off half the body fat of the original, would play to the same material. Oh, and its status as a Best Picture winner?

From cavernous undersea lairs to the vast horizons of Egypt, this Bond thriller keeps its tongue firmly in cheek with a plot tailor-made for daredevil escapism.Nobody does it better than Bond, and he proves it once more in this explosively entertaining adventure that takes him from the Egyptian pyramids to the ocean floor to a gravity-defying mountaintop ski chase!

After the razzle-dazzle of THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, this attempt to latch onto a trend proved to be a case of overkill, even though it brought back the steel-toothed villain Jaws (Richard Kiel) and scored a major hit at the box office.This time Bond is up against a criminal industrialist named Drax (Michel Lonsdale) who wants to control the world from his orbiting space station. In keeping with his well-groomed style, Bond thwarts this maniacal Neo-Hitler's scheme with the help of a beautiful, sleek-figured NASA scientist Dr. Holly Goodhead(played by Lois Chiles with all the vitality of a department-store mannequin).There's a grand-scale climax involving space shuttles and ray guns, but despite the film's popular success, this is one Bond adventure that never quite gets off the launching pad. It's as if the caretakers of the James Bond franchise had forgotten that it's Bond--and not a barrage of gizmos and gadgets (including a land-worthy Venetian gondola)--that fuels the series' success. Despite Moore's passive performance (which Pauline Kael described as like an office manager who is turning into dead wood but hanging on to collect his pension), MOONRAKER had no problem attracting an appreciative audience, and there are even a few renegade Bond-philes who consider it one of their favorites.MOONRAKER also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 6 going on 7 years old and saw it in the movies for the very first time back in the Summer of 1979 before it was shown on HBO for the very first time in January of 1981.\",\n",

Moonraker's abrupt juxtapositions of action sequences and goofy humor can be jarring, as when Jaws fights 007 on a tram that crashes into the station. We then see Jaws, cartoon-like, sitting on the ground with a large metal wheel around his neck that despite his superhuman strength he cannot push away until a diminutive pig-tailed woman Dolly shows up and helps him. They look at each other and as Jaws smiles his metallic grin, they instantly fall in love to the sounds of Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliette Overture-Fantasy, which swells satirically in the background. Moonraker is full of weird moments like this, including the opening where Jaws survives a free fall from an airplane by flapping his arms like a bird to aim to land on a circus tent. That's an unfortunate decision by the director, because it undermines the brilliant stunt sequence that preceded it.This movie obviously has Star Wars on its mind, right down to the sound effects of the lasers that inexplicably are mounted on he front of the American space shuttles.

The pacing of the film is interesting, but it's mostly a lot of disgusting violence and bloodshed (some of which is, I confess, entertaining) with some hit and miss performances thrown in. I had high hopes for the Coen Brothers when they began (I remember having fond memories of seeing the bizarre &#34;Blood Simple&#34; for the first time), but in this case they have hijacked the powerful McCarthy story and turned it into a narrative misnomer of a movie. As well photographed as the picture is (by Roger Deakins), there really is not that much to see here except for the violence--and the typical insulting characterizations that Joel and Ethan are known for. Overall, this DVD is fine, but the movie is a headlong plunge into meaninglessness. The film features a bad and way over-the-top performance by Javier Bardem (whose acting coach was a robot, no?), and an outstanding acting job by Brolin.

              "       \"Two big-scaled performances fuel this bleak study of a marriage falling apart, a look at how 2 intelligent, civilized people can become children again when it comes to divorce.Albert Finney is a blustering writer who's found a younger woman (Karen Allen); Diane Keaton is the bewildered wife who falls into the arms of a younger man (Peter Weller), a contractor around the house. This might be comedy rather than tragedy were it not for the presence of the couple's 3 daughters, the oldest of whom (Dana Hill) holds a particular grudge against her father.So the feel of the film is closer to a beautifully staged TV commercial than a searing Ingmar Bergman movie. Bo Goldman's script is heartfelt, but there doesn't seem to be much going on beneath the surface of this familiar saga.The performances by Finney and Keaton are expert, chivvying in whatever subtlety they can manage within Parker's overbearing world. The ending almost feels like a throwback to a certain strain of 1960s British cinema, and certainly doesn't let anybody--including the viewer--off the hook.This drama takes me all the way back to memory lane to when I was 9 years old in the 3rd grade during its theatrical release in the Winter of 1982 and when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was President.\",\n",

              "       \"The opening scenes of the mountains and lakes look as clear as a picture on a widescreen TV; there is no mistaking this visual opulence. The BluRay disc has a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, and this widescreen format fills out the edges of the screen so that one can see what kind of visual scheme that Kubrick was up to. The sound of the BluRay disc is also wonderful, with the music track working wonders and the sound effects genuinely eerie. The extras on this disc are also good, with the great Vivian Kubrick mini-documentary included, along with a pretty good audio commentary featuring Garrett Brown--this exciting inventor of the Steadicam speaks of how the film was intended to use this cinematographic camera technique in a new way, and his thoughts are pretty interesting for film historians to listen to. His contributions to Kubrick's visuals are significant here.As for the film, this is where the King began to slide down the mountain (I speak of Kubrick, not Stephen). Kubrick, unfortunately, believed that one could cure cinema (essentially clean it up of its &#34;badness&#34; and lazy qualities) by using scientific-like means  and peculiar methodologies to figure out what it is that works and what it is that doesn't while shooting a picture, and thus he stripped most of his later films of their enjoyable qualities. God knows that Kubrick was no Hitchcock--he would never have said that he wished he didn't have to go out and shoot the movie; a critic may suspect that Kubrick never had a finished map in his mind at all when he went out and turned every new project into &#34;Adventures in Attempted Filmmaking.&#34; I do like Jack Nicholson, and I am not surprised that these two guys did well together here. Is &#34;The Shining&#34; a horror film? To me, it's never been that scary at all, and I think that the murder-and-madness moments are too mundane to be truly menacing (rather than being muscular, they are more morose, moody but not maddening). In any circumstance, it probably is best that Stephen King stayed away from the project (despite his legions of fans shouting their protests of his cinematic inactivity over the years, sheesh), because when a filmmaker approaches a subject, he needs to see it as a movie and not as a literary abstract (I insist that fans of the book are missing the point about what Kubrick is doing here--he is NOT a good horror film director, and he misses the fun element of making a scary horror story (such as the animal topiary stuff)--but he is trying to create a visual experience as opposed to a truly cerebral one, so he obviously wouldn't care about the &#34;warmth vs. cold&#34; aspect behind King's critical assessment of this &#34;adaptation.&#34; The fact that he didn't call King in for help in adapting the script (and instead gave the book's draft to then-current Gothic professor Diane Johnson to expand and rethink) is proof that Kubrick saw King's work as being too pulpy and too slop-shop--he really wasn't interested in King's ideas. But, that being said, &#34;The Shining&#34; is an interesting visual experience, but it's not much else. B-\",\n",
              "       \"The wonderful Page carries yet another film of sweetness, concern, tragedy, renewal...difficult to juggle, but not in the capable hands of Geraldine Page. When F. Murray Abraham annoucned her name he prefaced it by saying &#34;the best actress in the English language&#34;. Whoopi was visibly disappointed.What we have here is a leveled, progressive performance, guided by director Peter Masterson, of a woman at wit's end, alone, with memories that she can't shed. The Great Depression took a toll, and she, in her elderly years, took refuge with her son and his materialistic wife in Houston. Carrie Watts just wants to go home, one more time.She's more adventurous than anyone thinks, and we're up for a fun adventure of redemption and true heartfelt desire.It's a lovely film, in so many ways. Horton Foote wrote this specifically for Page as a stage show, and expanded it for the screen (receiving  an Oscar nom for screenplay). Page has moments of reflection that are profound and disturbing, and there are volumes of subtext, shown through her bright eyes; never bitter, always hopeful in her faith.The film is not preachy with religion, so much as it's all she can fall back on. Excellent performances from John Heard, Rebecca de Mornay and Carlin Glynn throw so many different emotions into this film, that I'll be surprised that, at the end, anyone won't cheer and cry at the same time.After 8 Oscar nominations, Page finally won. She died the following year, at age 64. Not fair.Not fair at all, to those who crave just a little more of her brilliance.F. Murray wasn't wrong.\",\n",

Let's take a look at Christianity as myth: Zeitgeist The Movie on DVD makes it clear that Jesus probably didn't exist and the entire fairy tale of Christianity is nothing more than a rehash of ancient Egyptian religions which believe in an afterlife, so that the story of Jesus dying on the cross and being resurrected fulfills the Egyptian myth.\",\n",
              "       \"Linda Blair is beautiful (and young) here, and she is reason enough to find the film a ravishing visual movie. Yet there are other beautiful moments too--the African landscapes, the fantasy set pieces, the flight over the mountains on the wings of a locust--but overall the look is all that we can talk about here. I doubt that William Goodhart's source material was kept in its original state, and I think that the overall architecture of the story suffers due to this bit of dabbling in the pool of author's rights by studio henchmen. But, Richard Burton has never been more lethargic, and Louise Fletcher appears to be doing another Nurse Ratched (in emotionless caricaturing), with the sole intention of keeping that other movie alive in the minds of viewers. Is this a successful horror film? This depends upon what you think about the original--a disturbing, unique piece of art (controversial, but durable), but perhaps not anywhere near horror country (in truth). If you've come to this movie for more blasphemy, more blood, and more shocks, turn around and march the other way! This is by no means your typical horror entry--and I think the &#34;R&#34; rating was way too excessive. There are flashbacks to the original film's exorcism scene (well, sort of--it's a different actress, in a horrible new make-up job that makes you long for Linda/Eileen again) and a creepy sequence of an African exorcism scene (featuring Von Sydow again as Merrin), but really the absolute creepiest moment (to me) is the beginning, which features a suspected witch who burns up in a fire and evaporates before your very eyes(!)--but after that, you will be hard pressed to locate any graphic shocks elsewhere. Pauline Kael was very complimentary to this film in her review, but I think to overpraise it is a fallacy too. I enjoy it for its nostalgic value, but it is slow, uneven, and dramatically dodgy--but, again, there's always Linda!As for the DVD, this is a bare bones affair. Why no commentary track? Did a film sequel in history ever need one as much as this title? I think not! Also, a trailer is added, by why no vintage 'making of' documentary? I know that there had to be one since this is a sequel to one of the most controversial and popular films of all time. But it isn't to be found. The picture and sound design are good in transfer, but overall I think the picture could have been even sharper--but I have not seen the BluRay, if there even is one yet (?). This was a good fantasy film idea, but the execution is a bit rough, but nonetheless more enjoyable than most films (in places). B+\",\n",
              "       \"Like a freight juggernaut carrying the poisoned cargo of a screwed-up past coupled to a temptation-filled present - ex convict Jack Jordan is a train wreck waiting to derail yet again - only this time in spectacular fashion. At least at the hands of Preacher John (the ever stunning Eddie Marsan) Jack has discovered God and this has given him strength (Jesus gave me that truck...). But he still seems to be heading for that mental meltdown no matter how hard he believes and the inevitable loss of his freedom, his job and his family.Mexican Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu had made the brilliant Amos Perres in 2000 and it went a long way to drawing in huge talent like Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and especially Benicio Del Toro (as Jack Jordan). Not conventionally structured - 2004's 21 Grams uses the device of back and forward in time flashbacks to offer up a story of accidents and loss and extreme pain and how ordinary people cope with it (or not as the case may be).The structure is odd and at times grating - but it brilliantly unfolds the story so you slowly twig what's happened and to whom. One minute Jack Jordan is clean-shaven happily waving to his friends by his pick-up - the next he's in a prison shower again with a towel around his neck (and he isn't trying to clear up his zits). Sean Penn's character Paul River's is wheezing on a ventilator while he sneaks a cigarette from a pill bottle stash in the bathroom in one scene - then is healthy and immaculately suited in the next scene as he ogles a woman in a swimming pool (Naomi Watts) he seems overly interested in for a married man. One moment he's raising a glass of wine with his friends celebrating an organ transplant that has literally saved his life - the next Paul is lying in a hospital bed looking battered with tubes in his mouth - ruminating on the size of the bodyweight you lose when you die (the film's title).In between all of this we keep returning to a father (a brilliantly subtle Danny Huston) on his mobile to his wife. He is clearly not paying enough attention to his two young daughters giddily chasing a bird on the footpath ahead of him. As the three pass out of shot - leaves are blown ahead as a familiar-looking truck races past - and a few moments later (still out of shot) there's an ominous screech of tyres...While Sean Penn is typically magnetic - the movie belongs to Benicio Del Toro who straddles it like a malevolent colossus. In the 'Making Of' the Director says you need only point the camera at him and magic will happen - worlds going on behind a glance. Yet somehow (and there are repulsive scenes with his family) Del Toro fills his tattooed enraged Jordan with such gravitas that you empathise with his gradual loss of faith rather than judge him. In one scene he begs a startled man to kill him - end his torment - and you don't for a second think that he doesn't really mean it.But special praise should also go to the women who are simply astounding and in some cases act the showier male names off the frame. Charlotte Gainsbourg plays Sean Penn's wife Mary Rivers obsessed with having a child even if their relationship is disintegrating - while Melissa Leo plays the wife of the God-obsessed Jack Gordon trying to keep him out of jail and her family together (both are simply superb). But it's Naomi Watts who blows you away. There is a scene where she has to go the hospital to check on her husband and two daughters only to be given unfathomable news. As a parent you physically shake and ache with her harrowing disintegration (she's that good). The only other times I've ever seen this sheer acting power is in Bright Star about the life of poet John Keats and Fanny Brawne that has Abbie Cornish give the same kind of mind-blowing performance (see review) and Marion Cotillard's unbelievable performance in the Edith Piaf biopic La Vie En Rose.With a 1.85:1 Aspect Ratio (the full screen is filled) 'adequate' best describes the BLU RAY picture quality. It isn't great by any stretch of the imagination featuring many indoor and night scenes with an ever-present pallor of grain. Shooting was all about feel and immediacy - and prettily framed suburbia was never going to be part of the equation. But I'd still say that the power of the watch quickly dissipates any qualms on that front. The only subtitle is English for the Hard Of Hearing.There's also a great In Fragments Making Of where the Director gets all the cast and crew to throw red roses in the air at the start of shooting and white roses when they finish. Each of the principal actors get spots and they're praise and love of the work is palatable. Icing on the cake is Gustavo Santaoialla's stunning score of electric and acoustic heavy guitar strums (like a Mexican Ry Cooder). Gustavo also embellished Babel and The Motorcycle Diaries with the same emotion-tugging power.Nominated for 2 Oscars and 5 Baftas - 21 Grams is visceral cinema peopled with a plethora of actors giving 1000% to a script they know is hard-hitting yet somehow real world redemptive. Inarritu would go on to make the equally brilliant Babel and the seriously harsh Biutiful.In 2014 you can pick up the stunning 21 Grams for 10 bucks on BLU RAY - and that's a ten-spot well spent in my book...\",\n",
              "       \"One of Ron Howard's earliest and most endearing cinema masterpieces.  The movie tackles its title with tongue firmly planted in cheek and hits a bulls eye with almost every scene.  The cast is to die for and their comedy timing under the sure hand of a situation comedy pro (does anyone question Opie's credentials in that regard???) like Ron Howard is bound to make merry mirth of marriage and kids.  Look for a very early performance by Keanu Reeves.  The great Jason Robards lets his hair down here a bit  and Rick Moranis (where IS that guy??) is a hoot.  But of course my heart is with Mary Steenburgen, my one true crush though out the Eighties!  She holds it all together (with much more than a little help from Diane Wiest as I recall).  The movie is winsome, heartwarming and hilarious.  Buy it and have a really fun evening with the family!Why haven't I mentioned it's titular star Steve Martin?????  Because I can't think of this movie without seeing the Birthday Party in my mind and I fall down laughing and can't type every darn time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

              "       \"Unlike Shyamalan's later films, which combine interesting atmospherics and weirdly menacing scenarios that are psychologically believable, this one is a run-of-the-mill alien invasion flick.  It starts off strong, with a mystery as to why aliens are choosing to make first contact with earth, which is evidenced by crop signs.  Gibson is a fallen preacher and widower; at first he is skeptical, then listens to his children and begins to get scared as more happens.  With his loss of faith, he feels there is nothing that can help, so is fatalistic and frightened when they turn out to have bad intentions.  By that point, the film has degenerated into such a cliche that there is nothing whatsoever interesting about it - no surprise actions or reasons, just facing the baddies by baseball-bat force.  I found this deeply disappointing, given the talent of the actors.  Gibson's inevitable spiritual rebirth is laughably predictable and unoriginal.Not recommended except as background nonsense.\",\n",

              "       \"CONTACT stars Jodie Foster as an MIT-trained physicist, Matthew McConaughey as a self-trained man of the cloth and Jodie's love interest, and Tom Skerritt as the manager of a large-scale astrophysics project.  Smaller parts include Jake Busey as the religeious fanatic who blows up the astrophysics project.  James Woods plays a government official who is skeptical about the results provided by the astrophysics project, but (spoiler alert) who eventually changes his mind.  Angela Bassett plays White House Chief of Staff to President Clinton, who provides routine assistance to Jodie Foster.SUMMARY.  The film starts out with Jodie as a girl.  Her father trains her to monitor signals from space, using amateur electronics equipment.  One day, the father has a heart attack and croaks, leaving Jodie without a dad.  Eventually (fast forward), Jodie is a student at MIT acquiring a Ph.D. in astrophysics.  Years later, she tries to get funding to rent time on a radiotelescope in the desert to monitor signals from outer space.  Eventually, she is granted an audience with a funding agency, but she blows up in anger, because they are not sympathetic to her goals.  But an angel (angel is the technical term for a venture capitalist who funds projects on his own) steps in and funds her project.  With her project funded, Jodie continues to monitor signals from the radiotelescope in the desert.  John Hurt is one of her co-workers.  Eventually, the team discovers some strange signals that sound like washing machine sounds.  With the aid of computer processing (warning, another spoiler alert), the team discovers that the signals are really plans for building a huge machine.  The machine is an astrophysics gadget that enables the traveler to journey through a wormhole to meet her dead father.  The machine is built at Cape Canaveral.  Tom Skerritt, wanting to steal all of the credit from Jodie Foster, decides that he will be the first to use the machine.  But Jake Busey sneaks inside the facility, disguising himself as a technician, and blows up the whole thing, killing Tom Skerritt. Fortunately, (warning, another spoiler alert), a duplicate machine had been built on a remote island off of the coast of Japan.  Jodie Foster is allowed to take the journey in the machine in Japan.  She travels through space, journeys through a wormhole, and visits with her father on a beach.  When she returns, she is not able to convince anybody of what had happened, because the available evidence suggests that nothing had happened.  However, at the last minute in the movie, data demonstrated that what earthlings had perceived to take place in less than a second, actually represented a few hours of time for Jodie Foster.  The film ends with the the tantalizing realization that what Jodie had experienced had actually come to pass.GREAT LINES.  The screenplay is noted for some great lines.  For example, when Jodie was a girl, her father told her that it would be a waste of space if there was no life out there in the stars.  Years later, during her love affair with Matthew McConaughey, Matthew spontaneously comes up with the same concept, and says the same thing (it seems like an aweful waste of space) that her father had said years earlier.  This greatly increases the affinity that Jodie has for Matthew, as one might expect, given Jodie's love for her deceased father.At one point, Jodie is grilled by a large committee, where the issue is whether she should be allowed to journey in the machine.  Three people grill Jodie on the question, Do you believe in God?  This was meant to be a provocative question, and to brand Jodie as an atheist and therefore not adequate to be the first passenger on the space gadget.  Jodie replies, I don't believe that there is data either way, referring to whether God exists or doesn't exist.  When pressed further on this point, Jodie replies, I believe, um, I believe that I've already answered that question.  A similar dialogue occurs in GULLIVER'S TRAVELS with Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen, where Mary is asked if she believes the wild stories told by Ted Danson, who plays Gulliver.  Mary refrains from answering that she belives him, but instead answers, I belive in him.At an early point in the movie, Matthew opens up a box of Cracker Jack, and inside is a toy compass, and he gives this to Jodie as a momento.  This particular toy is kept by Jodie, through thick and thin, and it serves as a humble icon that is kept, just as Jodie keeps alive her affection for Matthew.  A toy compass in a Cracker Jack box also makes its appearance in the movie 1941, where actor Slim Pickens quickly swallows the compass so that the Japanese submariners will not be able to use it to find their way.  The common item (Cracker Jack compass) but totally different uses for this item, makes one of the more remarkable footnotes in the history of American cinema.Another amazing part of the script, is where Jodie Foster takes Angela Bassett aside, in order to ask an important question.  But as it turns out, Jodie's question is, Where can I get a really great dress?CONCLUSION.  I liked every moment of this film.  There were no dead sequences in the middle, meant to use up time.  The film was full of twists and surprises.  The film ends with a few ambiguities, though these ambiguities were intentional.  More than most films, this movie calls for a sequel.\",\n",
              "       \"About to assassinate a low-life on a bicycle - Martin Blank points his high-powered rifle, scope and silencer out the elevated open window of his hotel room at his mark - but then gets an interesting phone call on his headset from his handler Marcella. She's just opened a letter that has tickled her pink. As Martin takes aim - she reads out an invite to all alumni from the Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe - the class of 1986 is having a high school reunion dinner and dance - and he's invited. Marcella helpfully suggests that this would be an excellent chance to renew old friendships - maybe open up some new accounts - even meet with that Debi girl he's been obsessing over for 10 years - the cute one he left stranded in a $700 Prom Dress... But unscrewing his silencer after a rival assassin with huge handguns has mowed down his clients on the footpath opposite and thereby snafued his corporate assignment - Martin tells Marcella to shred it and heads off to his shrink Dr. Oatman to discuss the pros and cons of his 'rarified profession'...What makes Grosse Pointe Blank so incredibly fresh and funny is the double-whammy of a brilliant script and a perfectly picked cast. John Cusack is ideal as the matter-of-fact contract killer Martin Black (who won't kill Greenpeace activists or dogs), Joan Cusack (John's real life sister) as his ballsy secretary Marcella and the luminously gorgeous Minnie Driver as the love interest. Thrown into this double-crossing mess is Dan Akyroyd - in stunning form as Grocer - another hyper assassin who wants to form a co-op of killers to avoid embarrassing overlaps in their busy slaughter schedule (Make some money...killing important people...what'd ya say!).Then there's Alan Arkin in fabulous frowning deadpan therapist mode (Have you ever thought of not killing people!), Jeremy Piven as a high school buddy who lusts after a woman he can't have (Ten years man!) and Hank Azaria as a gleeful CIA operative who doesn't care what bad guy he shoots as long as he's the 'good guy' doing it. Piven would in fact later play Cusack's best buddy again in Serendipity (see separate review for the BLU RAY). And amidst all the explosions and mayhem are rapid-fire discussions about the latest vitamin supplements in cafes as each hides a gun in brown paper bags - worry about the overcrowded marketplace in hired killers - affectionate chats on The Pilipino Dwarf Sisters (Queens of the hotel hit!) - endless seeking of answers from Martin's weary shrink about his 'problem' - it's all so bloody good and gigglesome funny.The overall soundtrack is by Joe Strummer of The Clash - with perfectly placed tunes in-between like Guns `N Roses incendiary cover of McCartney's James Bond theme Live And Let Die as Martin steps out of his car to find his home has been bulldozed and replaced with a UNIMART CONVENIENCE STORE. DJ Debi (Minnie Driver) from the local town radio station WGPM plays The Specials Ghost Town as Martin drives around Grosse Pointe wondering where his past has gone (his mother is in a nuthouse and his father has drunk himself into a whiskey grave). But just maybe he can form a lasting relationship on this weird trip and actually enjoy a life that doesn't involve suitcases full of knives, semi-automatics and poison kits... Like the lovely and forgiving Debi says - maybe all he needs is a quick spiritual kick to the head...The Hollywood Pictures 15th Anniversary Edition on BLU RAY boasts a truly gorgeous remastered print that is defaulted to Full Aspect (no lines top or bottom) and this US title is REGION ABC - so plays on UK and European machines as well as all others.  Audio is English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital while Subtitles are English SDH, Spanish and French. A real shame is the total lack of extras - but the superbly clean and clear print is plenty for me.Written by Tom Jankiewicz, D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink and John Cusack - and Directed by George Armitage - I saw Grosse Pointe Blank at the cinema in 1997 and remember the audience loving it to bits - clapping the credits as they rolled up on screen. Re-watching it in 2014 on this cool BLU RAY - not only has it aged very well - but I'd suggest it's become something of a modern day classic.I'm serious about this process! Besides...I know where you live! Martin says to his alarmed psychiatrist Dr. Oatman.For just under ten bucks - I'd say heed that reformed man's advice and get this comedic therapy in your home...\",\n",

And if they forget their Christian values preached to them weekly in the stone cold church - the good Mayor is there to give the new young priest of 5 weeks (Hugh O'Connor) a helping hand with his sermons - and thereby get 'their' obedient flock back on the moral straight and narrow. Reynaud also waits patently and penitently for his wife to return from one of her interminable 'trips' - watched over his devoted secretary Caroline (the beautiful Carrie Anne Moss). But perhaps the hard-working and essentially decent Mayor (a fabulous turn by England's Alfred Molina) should just chill out and measure goodness by what we embrace - or maybe even recognize the lovely Caroline's devotion as genuine and worthy. But the Comte is too busy being pious and upright for the entire town - to engage in something that life-enhancing and delicious...Besides that's the least of his carnal worries - because a sly wind is blowing in from the North - bringing with it a voluptuous woman of independent-mind (Juliette Binoche) who is going to open a decadent nay sinful chocolate parlour in Lent - a time of abstinence, reflection and tranquillity. And when this shop Choclataire Maya opens - Mayor Reynaud knows deep down in his starched flannel trousers that it will seduce the town - especially the women. And the next thing you know - they'll be shagging their husbands senseless again - leaving the drunken abusive ones behind (Peter Stormare as Serge) - cavorting with travelling river people who play guitars and talk in odd Irish accents (Johnny Depp as Roux) and generally enjoying all manner of lurid sensory pleasure. It's important to now one's enemy... the Mayor muses ominously.Adapted from Joanne Harris' beloved novel by Robert Nelson Jacobs - Lasse Hallstrom's feature film (he also did The Cider House Rules - see separate review) garnished five Academy Award nominations - including one for Best Movie. And it's easy to see why. It has a magical and very visual story with fantastically strong parts for women. And it has chocolate - lots and lots of sweets, biscuits, cake and chocolate. You can get fat just looking at this film.The cast is varied and uniformly superb: French acting and dancing legend Leslie Caron is an elderly town lady admired and longed for by Monsieur Bierot (a lovely show by England's John Wood). There's Judy Dench in full-on spiky mode as the ballsy old biddy Armande (nominated for Supporting Actress - her dialogue titles this review) who rents out the former patisserie to Mademoiselle Vianne (Juliet Binoche in luminous form). Vianne's dreamy daughter Anouk (a delightful Victoire Thivisol) plays with an imaginary kangaroo - but is tired of wandering from town to town with her rootless mother - prone to leaving in an instant when the wind tells her to go.But as mum's culinary skills with South American cocoa and the dark evil liquid begins to affect the town folk in positive ways - especially a broken lady called Josephine (Lena Olin - who is Lasse Hallstrom's wife in real life) - the wandering Vianne senses that perhaps this hamlet is where her roots should be planted. In fact perhaps the town and its earnest but lost Mayor need her. And there's also the added enticement of that handsome rogue the Deppster to deal with - all gypsy and sexy shirts and dishevelled hair and good with her daughter. Easy to resist that...eh...Defaulted to Aspect ratio 1.78:1 - the BLU RAY picture fills the entire screen (no bars bottom or top) - but is a strange mixture of the ordinary and exceptional. I suspect in order to give the movie that slightly dreamy feel - there is a soft focus on a lot of it - and subtle grain is ever present. But there are also moments that are truly beautiful when you least expect it - down by the river at night, the feast to celebrate a 70th birthday in the garden, Alfred Molina trying to turn Serge into a gentleman in his home. It doesn't ever look bad - it's just not as stunning as you'd expect such a sensuous film to be.Audio is DTS-HD Master Audio Surround 5.1 and Subtitles are in English and English For The Hearing Impaired (a poor showing fro such an International film frankly). The Extras feature all the principal actors as well as legendary Hollywood Producer David Brown (Jaws, The Verdict, A Few Good Men).Chocolat is a classy piece of filmmaking - a sensory uplifting watch with passion truffles, cups of chilli-flavoured hot chocolate and Nipples of Venus.Give it a nibble you sinners...\",\n",
              "       \"One of the most violent films ever, director Peckinpah tried to tell a pagan tale about a wimpy man who is finally moved to violence against invaders when he realizes a primordial instinct to defend his home. As a violent, stomach-churning, nauseating (and this is a very unpleasant film to watch - not merely scary, but sickening)  roller coaster ride, this succeeds. As a film, it fails. What's wrong here? 1) The film is poorly paced. Poor editing could have helped here.  2) Dustin Hoffman is all wrong for the part of the wimpy husband. Yes, he's a nerdy little guy - but he never convinces when the transformation takes place and the character gets in touch with his primitive violent side. 3) Susan George is too beautiful to play the part of a nerdy mathematician's wife. She looks like a Playboy bunny - and like a woman who would have no interest sexually in mathematician/squirt of a man David Sumner, never mind marry him. 4) Some parts of the film make absolutely no sense. At the end of the film, Hoffman drives the mentally deranged Niles to his home?!! Niles just killed a girl and attempted to kill Hoffman's character's wife. Why is Hoffman not driving him to a police station? 5) The excuse for keeping a bear trap in the home is that the wife collects traps??!! Huh?? Give me a break. The only thing the wife collects is men.There's a lot of excitement here - once the violence begins, it is not only relentless, it escalates to a fever pitch. But this may leave a sickening feeling in your gut - it did mine. If Peckinpah's intention was to show how man can be reduced to violence because it is still a part of his primitive nature and ready to be unleashed when needed, he confuses the issue with his almost voyeuristic portrayal of rape. Is this anthropology or torture porn? It would have been a better movie if it stuck to the former.\",\n",
              "       'Mike Leigh has a way with spinning stories about disgruntled families in a way that feels so effortless and light despite the monumental weight that is often associated to them.  &#8216;Secrets & Lies&#8217; is one of his most beloved films (and one of his most critically acclaimed) and it is also one of the hardest to come across.  Seriously people, what&#8217;s with the lack of available DVDs?Emotionally driven yet astutely reserved, &#8216;Secrets & Lies&#8217; drifts along at a pace that keeps us intently glued to the screen without unveiling too much, too soon.  This story of a black woman who traces her birth mother down to a white woman living a lie and frantically so, is one of real depth and character.  What makes the film work so well is the tremendous cast, from Oscar nominees Brenda Blethyn and Marianne Jean-Baptiste to the real lingering presence, Timothy Spall and his scene partner, Phyllis Logan.  Spall is a marvelous example of bottled up emotions, displaying just enough to keep us constantly tuned into his next move.  Blethyn is frantic and chaotic, effectively so, and there really is nothing more heartwarming than the smile across Jean-Baptiste&#8217;s face as she takes in the reality of her new family.&#8216;Secrets & Lies&#8217; has some dark elements, but Leigh directs this in such a way that it all feels so organically pure.  Even when the foreknowledge that something unspeakable has taken place or will take place or will be unveiled, there is something bittersweet (the emphasis on &#8216;sweet&#8217;) about the whole thing, which makes it feel honest and heartfelt.This is considered Leigh&#8217;s finest film, for a reason.',\n",
              "       \"Creeping, poetic French horror that wears classical inspirations on its sleeve while trying to nudge the genre along in bleak new directions. It's a mixed bag, really. The superficial elements - framing, effects, visual themes - are top notch, real cutting edge stuff for the period. The sympathetic lead, a young woman whose face was ravaged by a violent car accident, wears a fragile, unsettling China doll mask to conceal her disfigurements. It's an especially powerful effect when combined with the rich black-and-white film stock, which makes it difficult to determine where the mask ends and her flesh begins. Late in the picture, as the girl's mad surgeon of a father graphically peels the skin away from an unwilling donor to &#34;fix&#34; his daughter's wounds, it's tough not to flinch. The scene, and the concept, is that convincing, that unnerving. The plot suffers from a serious lack of depth, however, retreading the same territory several times before making any progress, and the film plods along for too long as a result. A terribly loud, mismatched score further sours matters, flooding the room with brow-furrowing carnival music at regular intervals. It's a curious relic, one which clearly influenced a whole new generation of filmmakers in the years after its release, but probably works better as an exercise of original theories than a complete picture.\",\n",

Though I've seen it a half-dozen times, this was the first time I paid attention to Grace Kelly's black-and-white beach costume. Though exposing little more than her shoulders, it is //obscene//. (Why didn't the producer notice? Well, Hitchcock was the producer.)Until now, the only versions of To Catch a Thief I've viewed have been from 35mm reduction prints. This one is from the VistaVision negative, and there's no comparison. It's a different film. This is particularly noticeable in the ball sequence, where VistaVision's brilliant detail displays the jewelry and costumes in their opulent glory.The Lyn Murray score is //the best// of any of Hitch's non-Herrmann scores. Murray admired Herrmann (he does more with fewer notes than anyone else), and the influence is sometimes heard as a modest imitation of Herrmann, but more often in knowing exactly the sort of music required and where to put it.To Catch a Thief has risen in esteem over the years, and this Blu-ray edition shows why it's the best of his comic films.\",\n",
              "       \"The Getaway was volatile, unstable director Sam Peckinpah's attempt to make a profitable movie after a string of box-office bombs. Luckily, one of Hollywood's biggest stars at the time, Steve Mcqueen, enjoyed working with Peckinpah. When Producer Robert Evans sent his new wife Ali Macgraw (who was also a huge star at the time) to work with McQueen, he had no idea that they would fall in lust and that it would be the end of his marriage. The Getaway garnered a lot of gossip and box-office. It was Peckinpah's most successful film.The film is just okay. There are some exciting twists in the plot and the usual slo-mo bloodspurting violence you expect in a Peckinpah film but overall, I grew antsy waiting for this to end. McQueen is at his usual tough guy best. Macgraw simply cannot act to save her life. She doesn't deliver a single one of her lines convincingly. She seems to know only one note - a snotty delivery that sounds like a bratty, spoiled girl rather than the tough woman accomplice to an experienced criminal. She ruins the picture. Considered one of the world's great beauties at the time, today she looks like she had too much of her nose clipped off during plastic surgery. At some angles, she looks odd. But it's her acting that sucks.If you love McQueen, crime films, and explosive action scenes, this will fill half an afternoon for you. And then you will forget all about it.\",\n",
              "       \"That's the big question for any sort of sequel or addendum to Stanley Kubrick's visionary film. It stands on its own, a cosmic colossus of beauty & wonder as big as the Universe. Even Arthur C. Clarke's own novel, written in conjunction with the original film, necessarily falls short -- though it's a very good Clarke novel, I hasten to add.The only thing to do is judge this film as a work in its own right -- and on that basis, it's a good, solid, thoroughly re-watchable film. The cast is first-rate, the screenplay hews very closely to Clarke's own sequel, and it does evoke that sense of wonder so vital to quality science-fiction. While offering some answers to the Big Questions raised by the original, it also maintains an aura of mystery, the feeling of mere mortals encountering forces beyond their imagination -- and perhaps managing to grasp a glimmer of what those forces might actually portend.The obvious drawback for any viewer today is the political & technological sub-structure of the film. Clearly both aspects belong to the 1980s. But as with all good science-fiction, it addresses the issues of the day in which it was made, extrapolating from them; and the technology presented, as well as the special effects technology used to envision it, is top-of-the-line for its time. Let's face it, so many of the CGI special effects highly touted today will undoubtedly look just as dated some 30 years down the line. So what matters here is whether they did the best they could with what was currently available. I think they did, or at least came close enough.And as for the political aspect, of course that part is dated now. However, it does reflect the time in which it was made, when the Reagan administration had revived & ramped up fears of nuclear war with the Soviet Union. In addition, the political changes since then only reinforce the basic message of the film, however preachy at times: the macho military posturing of power-besotted human beings is not only infantile & horribly dangerous, but it means absolutely nothing compared to the immensity & mystery of the Universe. We have intelligence, we have incredible potential, and we shouldn't be wasting it on destructive ideologies, creeds, nationalism, or just plain greed.Yes, as a sequel to the magisterial 2001 this film must disappoint to some degree. But if you can set that aside & simply watch it as a strong adaptation of work by a grandmaster of science-fiction, then it comes off very well. It's not the transcendent experience of 2001 ...but it is quite entertaining & thoughtful, and worth many viewings. Recommended!\",\n",

What you see is what you get and for 110 excruciating minutes you are led along on this not so wild ride with the mysterious missing two minutes made all too painfully apparent in the end.Ravich missed his opportunity to weave a conspiracy tale into the plot.  Instead he had Joe Morton as a NASA representative who had uncovered the dark story of what happened aboard the space shuttle only to find himself holed up in a tenement in New York tracking former astronaut Spence Armacost as he and his wife climb up the social ladder.

              "       \"Tom Hanks breaks out in this light, charming, modestly funny fish-out-of-water comedy (har har) about a man's lifelong encounters with a lustily enamored mermaid. It can be tremendously naive at times, and the plot is about as telegraphed as they come, but there's something intangible about this picture that manages to gloss over many of those shortcomings. The central performance of Hanks is key, working as the plucky everyman he'd embody in most of his early repertoire, though this time it's dosed with a few fits of sharply possessive, unsettling anger. Maybe those shades just look bad in retrospect, as the film's a full generation old now, but it's tough not to cringe at such puzzling spots in the modern climate. I think the humor falls into a similar trap, in that it was probably more relevant at the time than it is today. A handful of comedies from the same era still serve as timeless examples of great humor (Ghostbusters, also released in 1984, springs to mind), and though a few of its gags and one-liners still connect, Splash isn't even in that ballpark after thirty years on the shelf. Hanks's easy rapport with John Candy is worth celebrating, though, and Daryl Hannah is positively breathtaking as the sweet, innocent fish-tailed beauty at the center of all the action. Simple, straight entertainment that's beginning to fade as it grows older.\",\n",
              "       \"Toward the end of the movie, Charles Manson addresses Bugliosi directly and seems to want some affirmation, but Bugliosi boldly states that Manson is just a con artist who manipulated a bunch of kids. This scene pretty much encapsulates the movie which is more about the court case than it is about Manson.One of the most fascinating thing about the Manson cult is just how far it went and how much people were willing to go to stay in the cult. It wasn't a fast process easy. People joined the cult because they wanted to get away from their stifling conservative upbringing and embrace a new post-structural form of morality. The problem that happens when you make up your own rules and form subcultures is the fact that you feel guilty for rejecting people. Rejection is supposed to be in the realm of the conformists. You should be accepting of everyone in certain subcultures and that means that you can be making yourself vulnerable to sociopaths. These kids were particularly vulnerable to the manipulation of a sociopath.Unfortunately, like the book, this movie concerns itself with the court case. It delves into Manson a little, but it shows us what people in the late sixties saw - one crazy dude and his followers who couldn't stop interrupting court proceedings. The movie is very much a product of its times - the 70s &#34;let's get tough on crime&#34; belief that led to our current system where jails are overcrowded and the best society has to offer in anti-recidivist programs is Scared Straight. The cult members are just crazy or evil, laughing and cackling all along.

Unspoken histories flesh out most every character, allowing even generic walk-ons to mosey into the picture at most any moment and cast ripples throughout the entire tapestry. It can be slow at times, and the casting of a very obviously non-native actor to lead the stereotypical enemy Comanche tribe doesn't sit well, but both such faults can be generally chalked up to the dated eccentricities of that era.
